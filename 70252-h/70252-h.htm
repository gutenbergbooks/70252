</div>

<p class='c006'>Three years passed, and nothing occurred to disturb
the even tenor of Virgie’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had worked diligently during this time, gaining
fresh laurels with every season. She had removed from
the retired lodgings which she had taken at first upon
coming to San Francisco, into a better locality, where
she had a handsome suite of rooms in a well-known
apartment-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>These were bright and pleasant, tastefully furnished
also, and Virgie thoroughly enjoyed the pretty home
which she had won by the labor of her own hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had made the change she gave the contents
of her other home to Chi Lu, who had married a
thrifty woman of his own country, and together they
were carrying on quite a flourishing laundry business,
while, in place of the faithful Chinese, Virgie had taken
a bright and capable Swedish woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening, after a dreary, rainy day, the bell under
the name of “Alexander,” in the house of which we
have been speaking, was pulled by a vigorous hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie was in her chamber, putting her little girl to
bed—a service which she enjoyed, for the child always
expected a merry frolic and then some “pretty story before
the dustman came.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She heard the bell, and soon after voices in the pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>parlor leading from her chamber, and she wondered
who could have chosen such a stormy night to call
up her, for she seldom had visitors, even in pleasant
weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently Mina, the Swede, came to her, and said that
a gentleman was waiting to see her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is he? Did he give no name?” Virgie questioned,
surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, madam. I asked him, and he said there was no
need to take his name, for you would know him when
you saw him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie’s heart beat more quickly at this, and a feeling
of dread took possession of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight came to see her occasionally, and one or
two of his clerks had been there a few times on business,
but Mina knew them, so she was sure it was none of these,
but someone who must have known her in the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>She finished the story she was telling little Virgie,
made some trifling changes  in her toilet, and
then went into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A gentleman was seated by the table, with his back
toward her, and though he had on a heavy overcoat,
and his form was considerably bowed, and his hair very
gray, there was something familiar about him that sent
a sudden shock through Virgie’s frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she went forward to greet him he suddenly arose
and turned toward her, bending a pair of piercing black
eyes searchingly upon her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie stopped short as she met that glance, all the
color leaving her face, while a startled cry escaped her
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man flushed, and his eyes sank guiltily before hers
as he said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know me, then, Virgie?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“Uncle Mark!” she gasped, and then sank weakly into
a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am your Uncle Mark,” the man returned, a
touch of bitterness in his tone; “but I scarcely expected
that you would acknowledge me as such. Where is your
father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mark Alexander staggered as if some one had struck
him a sudden blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did he—die?” he asked, with whitening lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six years ago last November.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man sank back into his chair, and bowed his head
upon the table, with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Profound silence reigned in the room for several
minutes, while each occupant was tortured by bitter
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie could scarcely realize that at last the man who
had wrought her father’s ruin was sitting in her presence.
She had never seen him but once since that dreadful
time when the thunderbolt had fallen to crush them
all, and that had been when she had fled from him in
the street more than three years previous. She wondered
how he had found her now. She had hoped
she should never meet him again; she feared him; she
abhorred him for the crime and wrong he had committed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart was even now filled with great bitterness
toward him, for, but for him her dear father might have
been living, an honored and respected citizen of San
Francisco, and she could only remember how he had
suffered, how, believing his name forever dishonored,
he had fled, as it were, into the wilderness, there to drag
out a weary existence among strangers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>A heavy sigh at length aroused her from these unhappy
musings, and she glanced at her companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could see that he, too, was sadly changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently the last twelve years had been far from
happy ones with him. His bowed form, his haggard
face and gray hair, all told of a mind ill at ease, of a
heart tortured by fear, if not with remorse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apparently, too, he had been very ill; he might even
be so still, for he was fearfully emaciated, his face was
hueless, and he was trembling with either weakness,
cold, or emotion, perhaps all three combined.</p>

<p class='c007'>His coat was drenched in the heavy rain in which he
had come, and he looked so utterly wretched and forlorn,
that something of pity began to crowd the anger from
her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Mark,” she said, trying to steady her trembling
voice, “you have taken me so by surprise that I am
forgetful of my duty. Remove your wet coat, and come
nearer the fire, while I ring for a cup of tea and some
supper for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! then you will not turn me out again into the
storm. Still you cannot have much but hatred for me in
your heart,” he returned, lifting to her a face that was
almost convulsed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust that nothing would make me unmindful of
the duties of hospitality, especially toward one who is
ill and suffering as you appear to be,” Virgie answered,
as she arose and went out to confer a moment with Mina
regarding the comfort of her unbidden guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Aunt Margaret?” she inquired, when she
returned, a few moments later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! and Philip?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Dead—and little Bertha, too. All are gone—victims
of cholera, while I have not known a well day since I
had it,” the man answered, in a harsh, unnatural voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie felt the tears rise to her eyes, and her heart
softened still more. Surely his punishment had begun,
and in no light manner, if death had so quickly robbed
him of all his family, ruining his own health also.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you know that I was here in San Francisco?”
she asked, after another painful pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started at her question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw you here more than three years ago. I was
not quite sure it was you the first time I met you, and
I followed you, hoping to learn where you lived; but
you evaded me without knowing it, that time. The
next day I haunted the place where I lost sight of you,
and came upon you just as you turned the corner, you
remember. You knew me, I was very sure, by the look
of dismay that sprang to your eyes. I was more sure
after your little strategy in that store. But I wanted
to see you desperately, Virgie. Didn’t you see my advertisement
among the personals?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but I—could not meet you. I—could not forget,”
faltered Virgie.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man shivered at her words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I cannot blame you. But never mind that now.
I meant to find you if I could; but I made up my mind
after a while that you and Abbot had left San Francisco—I
had not a thought that he was dead—and so I went
elsewhere to hunt for you. I have spent the last three
years in wandering about, but finally came back here to
end my days. I was in at Knight’s bookstore a day
or two since. There was a pile of new books on the
counter, and as I stood looking at one of them a gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>came for one, and said to a boy, ‘I want you to
take one of Mrs. Alexander’s new books around to her.’
The name startled me. I turned to the title page, and
saw ‘Virginia Alexander’ printed there, as the author.
I bought a copy, and followed the boy here. I should
have come to see you yesterday, but I was not able to
get out; I had hardly strength sufficient to-day, but
to-night despair drove me out in spite of the storm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid you were imprudent. But what can I
do for you, Uncle Mark?” Virgie asked, hardly knowing
what to say to the returned fugitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you that by and by. Can I—will you let me
stay here to-night?” he humbly asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie had but two beds, her own and her servant’s,
but she had not the heart to send him forth again into
the storm, he looked so ill and miserable; so she replied,
with a look of pity:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor creature broke down and sobbed at her kindness,
but he recovered himself after a moment, and
turned away from her gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is my nerves,” he explained; “I am a total wreck;
I am utterly shattered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mina now came in with a tempting little supper, and
he was more composed and cheerful after he had eaten
something and taken a cup of tea, and soon began to
talk more freely of his past.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been in the East Indies, he told Virgie, engaged
in the spice trade, most of the time since his flight
from San Francisco. But he had never known a moment
of peace since the day that he had fled with all
the available funds of the bank, of which he had been
the cashier, and his brother the president, for he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>known well enough that the good name of the latter
would have to suffer as well as his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At first,” he said, “I tried traveling, throwing myself
into every excitement, and took my family with me.
But it would not do; the fortune which I had stolen
and was trying to enjoy, was like a mill-stone about
my neck; the word ‘thief’ was branded upon my heart
with every beat of my pulse, until, in despair, I at last
located at Batavia, on the island of Java, and threw
myself, heart and brain, into business. I invested the
most of my ill-gotten gains where they would be safe,
and began to speculate with the rest. The Bible says
that ‘the wicked shall not prosper;’ but I did—if you
call it prospering to have money literally pouring in
upon you and be nearly distracted with an accusing
conscience at the same time. The richer I grew the
more wretched I became. I had heard that your father
had sacrificed all that he was worth toward wiping out
my iniquity; but of course I knew that it could not
begin to make my defalcation good, and that people
would only scoff and sneer, and say it was all pretense—doubtless
we were in league and would share equally
in the spoils. I knew his high sense of honor, and how
sensitive he was, and I believed the blow would crush
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It did! it did!” cried Virgie, bursting into a passion
of tears, as all the sad past came pressing upon her with
this recital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor child! poor child!” returned her uncle, tremulously.
“But you and your father were in a state of
bliss compared with me. Then there came that terrible
epidemic sweeping all whom I loved in three days from
the face of the earth, and bringing me, also, very near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>to death’s door. When it was all over, and I knew
that I was to live, I felt that there remained but one
thing for me to do—to come back here and make an
open confession of everything, and atone, as far as
I was able, for the mischief I had wrought. If I could
have found Abbot I should have done this long ago. Oh,
my brother, I wish you had not died!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again he broke down, and Virgie felt herself fast
melting toward him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not but feel that his repentance had come
far too late, but he was much too wretched not to appeal
to her sympathies.</p>

<p class='c007'>They talked for several hours, she telling him all that
had occurred since his flight, though she touched but
lightly upon her individual sorrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he appeared so exhausted that she finally persuaded
him to retire, giving up her own room to him,
she and little Virgie occupying Mina’s, while the girl
slept upon a lounge in their small dining-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>When morning came Mr. Alexander was too ill to
rise, and feared that he was going to have a relapse of
his former illness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He grew better, however, toward evening, and seemed
to be so grateful for the care which his niece had given
him, so repentant for the sorrow that he had brought
upon her, that she was deeply touched.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few days he appeared much stronger, and
seemed greatly interested in Virgie, her work, and particularly
in her little one. Still, he did not seem to be
quite at his ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not mean to be such a burden upon you, Virgie,”
he said, humbly, one afternoon, as she was performing
some little service for him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“I do not consider you a burden. I am glad if I can
make you comfortable, Uncle Mark,” she returned,
kindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall not be a loser for your kindness to me,”
he added, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie turned upon him sharply, her face flushing
crimson, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Mark,” she retorted, in a clear, decided voice,
“whatever I have done for you has been done from sympathy,
and because I felt it my duty to minister to your
needs; but I shall never receive any compensation from
you—I could not. If you are as rich as you have hinted
several times, I want you to right the wrong that you
committed so long ago. There is much that still remains
unpaid, even though the bank has long since
resumed business. Many depositors lost heavily; there
were several years that no interest was paid to them,
and their funds were so locked up that they could not
have what rightfully belonged to them, and much suffering
was occasioned by it. All this—<em>everything</em> must
be paid to the uttermost farthing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It shall be done. I will do all that can be required
of me. But, Virgie, <em>you</em> have been the heaviest loser
of all through what your father paid out for me, and
that will be one of the debts to be canceled with the
rest. Don’t let your pride prevent my relieving my
conscience of that obligation,” said the sick man, tremulously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie had not thought of the matter in that light before.
Her chief desire had been to have a confession,
and restitution made to the bank and all depositors,
and thus clear her father from all imputation of wrong-doing.
She had never reckoned herself among the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of the injured—never counted upon receiving a dollar
in return for the sacrifice her father had made. To
have his honor re-established, and then be able to bring
his body back to rest beside her mother, would give her
more joy than she ever expected to know again in this
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa’s good name is more to me than all else,” she
said, tearfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear child, it shall be fully restored; his honor vindicated.
Oh, that he could have lived to know it!
That it could not is the hardest part of my punishment.
But after I have done that, you will not refuse
to receive what I can offer you?” pleaded Mark Alexander,
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you satisfy <em>all</em> claims upon the bank?” Virgie
asked, in surprise, for she knew that the interest of
all those years would amount to a great deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can do far more than that, and to-morrow I will
make a beginning, if I have the strength. What I
do must be done quickly, for my days are numbered.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h2 id='II' class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>VIRGIE RECEIVES A MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Virgie, remembering her promise to Mr. Knight, to
let him know if she ever met her uncle in San Francisco
again, determined to consult with him regarding
Mark Alexander’s intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that he would advise her rightly, and
relieve her from all anxiety in the matter. She feared
that her uncle might be arrested and tried for the
crime that he had committed, in spite of the fact that
he was willing and eager to make full restitution, and
he was far too ill a man for any such excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she did not have to fear this long, for he was
suddenly attacked with very alarming symptoms and
his physician told him plainly that he would never
leave his chamber again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is far better so,” he said to Virgie, when he told
her of the verdict, “for nothing can occur now to
cause you any annoyance. I shall be glad to have
‘life’s fitful fever over,’ and can die content if you
will assure me that you forgive me for all the unhappiness
I have caused you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do, Uncle Mark,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>And she was sincere. She could freely forgive him
for all <em>she</em> had suffered through his wrong-doing, but
she could not quite forgive him for the shame and
sorrow her father had endured on his account.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be sure the truth would all come out now, restitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>would be made, and the world would know
that Mark Alexander alone had been guilty of the
crime imputed to his brother as well; but her father
was not there to experience the benefit of tardy justice,
and, though grateful, she was only partially content.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sent for Mr. Knight and confided the whole matter
to him. He told her to leave it all with him, and
he would see that full justice was done.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a conference with the invalid a lawyer was
sent for, a full confession of the crime was written
out and signed in the presence of the required number
of witnesses, after which he made his will, making
Mr. Knight his executor, and bequeathing all that was
necessary of his fortune to liquidate his indebtedness
to the bank he had wronged, the remainder to
go to his niece, Virginia Alexander, and her heirs forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this important business was finished, the lawyer
and witnesses gone, Mr. Alexander requested Virgie
to bring him a package of papers she would find
in the lower part of his trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>She complied, and then he asked her if she would
assist him in looking them over, as he wished to destroy
those that were of no value and leave some
directions regarding the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a great many of them, and they were of
various descriptions, therefore their examination required
some time. But at last everything seemed to
be arranged satisfactorily—all but one sealed package,
which the invalid had laid aside from all the
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he now took up, remarking, as he viewed it
thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“There is quite a romantic history connected with
this, and it came into my hands in a remarkable way.
I am going to tell you the story, and then give the
package to you to keep for the owner, if you should
ever be fortunate enough to find her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! It is something that some one has lost?”
Virgie remarked, looking interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I stopped in London for a few days on my
way home from the East. But on the last day of
my stay I gave up my room at the hotel several hours
before I left, and went into the gentlemen’s reception-room
to read my paper. I was far from well, and the
noise and smoke there annoyed me exceedingly, so I
stole into a small parlor devoted to ladies’ use, and
seating myself behind some draperies in a bay-window,
gave myself up to the enjoyment of solitude and the
news of the day. I must, however, have soon fallen
asleep, for I was not conscious that any one had entered
the room until I heard the voices of two ladies
almost beside me. How long they had been there
I do not know, and my first impulse was to make my
presence known and then leave the room. But this
seemed an awkward thing to do, particularly as they
might have been talking some time before I awoke,
and they might consider me very ill-bred for having
remained a listener to what had already been said.
Then, I thought, I was an utter stranger to them; I
was about leaving for another country, and whatever
the nature of their conversation, it could make no difference
to either them or me, if I did overhear it. It
proved to be very harmless, however, until just as
they were about to separate, one lady remarked to
the other:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘By the way, as we are going to the Continent for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>a while, I want to ask you to take charge of a package
for me. It would be valuable to no one excepting
myself, and yet if it should chance to fall into other
hands during my absence, it might occasion me a great
deal of trouble. I know it will be safe with you, and
if anything should happen to me while I am away,
I want you to burn it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Very well, I will do as you wish,’ returned her
companion, as she appeared to receive something that
the other handed to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They conversed a few moments longer, and then
arose and left the room. I judged that they had met
there at the request of the lady who was going abroad,
simply to take leave of each other, and I thought no
more of the affair until I took my seat in the evening
train for Edinburgh, whence I was to go to Glasgow
to await the sailing of a steamer for home. A lady
entered just after I was seated, and while giving some
directions to the porter who brought in her
luggage, her voice struck me as familiar. Still I
could not place her—indeed I was very sure I had
never seen her before, and being exceedingly wary I
settled myself in a corner and was soon fast asleep.
When I awoke it was very dark outside, though the
coach lamps burned dimly above me, and I found myself
alone in the compartment; my companion, whoever
she might have been, had left the train.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judging from the cramped condition I was in, I
must have slept a long time and very soundly. I arose
to stretch myself and change my position, when my
foot struck some object on the floor. I stooped and
picked up the package. Taking it nearer to the light
I found that its seal was stamped simply with a coat
of arms, while there was written on the back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>wrapper, ‘To be destroyed, unopened, in the event of
my death.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Instantly it flashed upon me that the lady of the
familiar voice, who had been my companion, was one
of the women who had been in the ladies’ parlor at
the hotel that afternoon, and that this was the very
package intrusted to her care by her friend. Of
course I would not presume to open the package to
ascertain to whom it belonged, and I had not the
faintest idea what to do with it, for no names had been
called during that interview to enlighten me as to the
identity of the ladies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the train stopped again I asked the guard
at what station my companion had left. He did not
know; he said the guards had been changed at Sheffield,
and the lady must have got out before that, as
I was alone in the compartment when he came on.
I was both puzzled and annoyed. I did not like to intrust
the package to any one connected with the
train, for I judged from what the lady had said that it
contained something of great importance—at least to
her. I did not doubt that inquiries would be made
for it, for doubtless the woman who had lost it would
be in great anxiety about it. My time was not valuable,
and I began to be considerably interested in my
discovery, so I resolved to return to London, and wait
to see if any inquiries were made regarding the lost
package. Accordingly I took the next train back, and
the following morning, I myself inserted a notice
in some of the papers, describing what I had found
and stating where it could be obtained. I remained
in the city a fortnight, but no one ever came to claim
the package, and though I closely examined the newspapers,
no inquiry for it ever appeared. I felt that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>had done my whole duty in the matter, so I again
started for home, bringing my mysterious possession
with me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is just as I found it. I confess I have often felt
a curiosity regarding its contents, but I have respected
the owner’s evident desire that it should remain
a sealed matter to every one save herself. I am
going to give it to you now, Virgie. Of course, I
know it is very doubtful whether you will ever meet
the owner, but I do not like to destroy it, fearing
there may be something of importance contained in
it. Here it is, just as I found it, and if you should
ever happen to hear any one mention having lost a
sealed package on the Edinburgh train, this may prove
to be the one. It can easily be identified by the crest
upon the seal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie took the mysterious thing and examined it
with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was of an oblong shape, nicely wrapped in thick
white paper, sealed with red wax, upon which had
been stamped a coat of arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a queer looking device,” Virgie said. “A
shield bearing a cross that is doubled crossed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet, it is what is called a patriarchal cross. I was
curious about the crest, so I studied up a little on the
subject of heraldry; and the motto is certainly an excellent
one, ‘<i><span lang="fr">Droit et Loyal</span></i>,’ meaning ‘Upright and
Loyal,’” returned the sick man, with a sigh, as if
the words were a stab at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie turned the package over, and found written
there, in an evidently disguised hand, the sentence,
“To be destroyed unopened in the event of my death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel almost as if I hold the fate of someone in my
hands,” she said, a slight shiver disturbing her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>She was not naturally superstitious, but she experienced
a very uncomfortable sensation in the possession
of the mystic thing, and years after the words
that she had just uttered returned to her mind
with peculiar force; she did indeed hold the fate of a
human being in her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you do not like to keep it, if the knowledge of
its possession becomes irksome or burdensome, then
destroy it,” her uncle said, as he noticed that she was
strangely affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will keep it for the present,” she answered.
“There is no probability, however, that the owner and
I will ever meet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know; stranger things than that have
happened, our lives cross those of others in a marvelous
way sometimes,” returned Mr. Alexander, dreamily.
“I believe,” he added, arousing himself after a
few moments, “that some power stronger than myself
has influenced me to preserve that package, and
to confide it now to you. I am impressed that it may
even prove useful to you. Let me advise you to take
good care of it, Virgie, keep it, say for twenty years,
if you should live so long, and then, if nothing has
come of it, do what you like with it; by that time it is
doubtful if it could do the owner either harm or
good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, I will do as you suggest, Uncle Mark,”
Virgie answered, and saying this, she arose and locked
it in a small drawer in her writing-desk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mark Alexander failed very rapidly after that. Disease
and remorse had done their work pretty effectually,
and in less than three weeks from that stormy
evening when he had come to Virgie he was laid to
his last, long rest in Lone Mountain Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>After this Mr. Knight lost no time in carrying out
the instructions he had received, and instituted measures
for making ample restitution for the crime that
had been committed nearly twelve years previous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bank from which Mark Alexander had stolen
so largely had been nearly ruined. All payments had
been suspended for years, and the most strenuous
exertions were made to turn to the best advantage
the comparatively small assets left, and thus prevent
a total loss to the depositors and stockholders. It had
been but a little while since it had been able to resume
business upon its former basis, and it will be readily
understood that the accession of nearly half a million
dollars—the sum returned to them by the former
criminal—was most joyfully received by the directors.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statement of the fact was published, together
with an announcement that all depositors who had
suffered from the defalcation would receive remuneration
for all loss and annoyance in the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbot Alexander, the former president, was exonerated
from all blame. Every taint, every doubt and
suspicion were removed from his name, and justice
was at last rendered to an honest man. A glowing
tribute was paid to his nobility of character, to his rare
talents as a business man, and to the spirit of self-sacrifice
he had manifested at the time of the trouble, in
giving up all his own wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a day long to be remembered by Virgie,
when all this was proclaimed to the world. The papers
were full of it, and seemed to vie with each other in
trying to atone for the wrong which Abbot Alexander
had so patiently suffered, which had broken the heart
of his gentle wife and driven his wife and his beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>daughter into exile. It was tardy justice, but it was
ample and complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>But little was said of Mark Alexander and his wonderful
prosperity since his defalcation, but that little,
while it did not conceal or condone the crime that he
had committed, commended most highly that last act
of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also hinted in these same papers, that the
talented author of “Gleanings from the Heights,” and
several other charming productions of the same character,
was the daughter of the lamented bank president
who had been so cruelly maligned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if my father could have but known of this!”
Virgie exclaimed, when talking the matter over, afterward,
with Mr. Knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be very sure that he does know it,” he
responded, gravely. “It is to be regretted that he
could not have known it before his death; it would
have helped to soothe his last days. But still, if anything
can add to his joy in another world, the fact
that his name is to-day held up as one of the most
honored in San Francisco, must contribute to it, as
also must the knowledge that his daughter will henceforth
be relieved from all pecuniary care or anxiety.
You are really quite a wealthy young woman, my
friend,” the publisher concluded, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Am I?” Virgie questioned, absently.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was thinking of those weary years among the
mountains when, day after day, her father came and
went, to and from the mine, like a common laborer,
toiling persistently and patiently, so that she might
have a competence when he could care for her no
longer. “And all for naught!” she mused, with a bitter
pang, “for had not that also fallen into the hands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>an adventurer?” It seemed to have been his fate to
accumulate for others to spend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How indifferent you are! Have you no curiosity
about the matter?” questioned Mr. Knight, archly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course I have,” Virgie answered, rousing
herself from her reverie. “Is the amount that remains
to me finally determined?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; there will be about a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars—not much more than half what your
father sacrificed for his brother, but sufficient to
make you quite independent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So much!” exclaimed Virgie, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is quite a snug little fortune, and I am glad for
you. There will be no longer any need for your working
as you have done, and I am afraid I must lose
my matchless designer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed you will not,” Virgie cried eagerly; “that
is, if you will allow me to continue my work. I have
become so accustomed to regular employment—I love
my work so well, that I shall be far happier to continue
it. I will not try to do quite so much,” she
added, thoughtfully, “now that there is no actual
necessity for it; I will perhaps give you one or two
designs a year, but I could not think of living an idle
life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be only too glad to get anything from your
pen,” Mr. Knight returned. “But what do you think
about removing to New York? I am contemplating
giving up my business here and establishing myself
in New York city. My partner, who, as you know, is
a younger man than I, wants to branch out a little
more than I care to at my age, so I have sold out to
him. Still, I, too, am unwilling to be idle, so I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>I will go East and do a little quiet business on my
own account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It matters very little to me where I am located,”
Virgie said, with a sigh. It was a little hard, she
thought, not to have any ties anywhere. “I should
like to travel a portion of every year, and I may as
well make my headquarters in New York as anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And now it seemed as if a very peaceful, if not
delightful future lay before her; yet, aside from the
many advantages which her newly acquired wealth
would enable her to give her child, its possession gave
her but very little pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not believe that life would ever hold any
special enjoyment for her again. Excepting her child,
she had not a single object for which to live, nothing
to look forward to. She cared little for society, indeed
she shrank from meeting strangers; at least,
those in her own position in life, although she went
much among the poor, and spent money freely upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Knight went to New York she went also,
making a quiet but elegant home for herself not far
from his residence, where he and his sister kept
bachelor’s and old maid’s hall, and there she lived
her uneventful life, with nothing save a season of
travel now and then, to vary its monotony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus several years went by. She never heard one
word either from or of Heathdale; she knew not
whether Sir William was living or dead, prosperous
or otherwise, though often her heart yearned for
some tidings of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>One summer, when little Virgie was nine years of
age, they went for a week or two to Niagara Falls.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Virgie had never visited the place, and she promised
herself a rare treat in studying nature there in all its
grandeur, and in making some sketches for the coming
winter’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>She reached the village late in the day, and was
driven directly to one of the principal hotels, where
she ordered a couple of rooms—for she had a maid
with her—and then stepped to the office to register.</p>

<p class='c007'>After she had done so she carelessly glanced over
some of the preceding pages to see who were guests
in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the top of one of the pages, and under the date
of a week previous, she saw three names that sent
every drop of blood back upon her heart and turned
her giddy and faint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William Heath and wife. Master Willie Heath
and maid,” she read, and every letter seemed as if it
had been branded in characters of fire upon her brain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 id='III' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>VIRGIE SHALL YET HAVE HER INHERITANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Could it be possible that the man who had been her
husband had come again to this country, accompanied
by the woman who had supplanted her?</p>

<p class='c007'>They had a child too, it seemed, a young heir, and
they were all underneath the same roof with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment she was dazed with the knowledge;
then she was tempted to dash the pen through her own
name and fly to some other place.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she did not like to make herself conspicuous; even
now the clerk had noticed her emotion, and was asking
her if she was faint and would like a glass of water. So
she braced herself to face whatever might come, though
she felt as if it would kill her to meet the man who had
once called her wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>She resolved to go to her rooms and remain in them,
at least for a day or two, then she would quietly leave
the hotel and go to some other.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found her apartments very pleasant, overlooking
the river and the rapids, while in the distance she could
hear the never-ceasing roar of the falls. But there were
no attractions in the place now for her; all interest had
been swallowed up in the intense excitement that had
taken possession of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She slept but little that night, and during all the next
day she was wretched and almost ill. All her wrongs
seemed to rise up afresh before her, and she wondered
that Sir William had dared to cross the ocean lest her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>vengeance should overtake him. He was traveling, too,
the same as he used to, as plain Mr. Heath. Oh, how
supremely happy she had been in those lovely rooms in
New York, when she had believed herself to be his
honored wife, and was looking forward to a bright future
as the mistress of Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now she believed another was reigning there.
She wondered if she was fair and lovely; if she had
ever suspected the wrong that her husband had done
his first wife. She wondered, too, if Sir William had
ever legalized that mock marriage after receiving the
notice of his divorce from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>All day she lay there, too miserable to rise, listening
to every footfall that passed her door; she believed that
she could recognize <em>his</em> step, even though a decade of
years had passed since she had heard it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When night came again she was nearly worn out,
and, with little Virgie clasped close to her heart, she
slept the sleep of exhaustion, and awoke the next morning
feeling stronger and much refreshed, though still
very unhappy.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would not go down to breakfast, however, but
had it served in her room. She had not courage to
come face to face with the man who, she believed, had
so wronged her; she shrank from him, but even more
from the woman who, she supposed, occupied the position
that belonged to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast she dressed her little daughter in the
daintiest manner, and sent her out for a walk with her
maid, telling the latter that she might keep Virgie out
as long as desired, as she was not feeling well and wished
to be quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were gone she lay down again, and tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to think what was best for her to do. Should she go
away immediately, and avoid all danger of being seen
and recognized? Should she fly from the temptation
that was fast laying hold of her to look once more upon
the old-time lover—the father of her child?</p>

<p class='c007'>She feared that it was not wise for her to linger there;
indeed she knew that it would be far better for her
peace of mind to turn resolutely away from all that pertained
to the past, go elsewhere, and try to forget—if
that were possible—that such a person as Sir William
Heath had ever existed.</p>

<p class='c007'>She fell asleep while musing thus, and was conscious
of nothing more until someone knocked upon her door,
and a childish voice called out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma! mamma! oh, please let me in. I want to
tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie aroused herself, and going to the door, unlocked
and opened it, and was confronted by her little daughter,
her face flushed and eager, her hat hanging from her
neck by its blue ribbons, her golden curls floating in
charming disarray about her shoulders, while she held
by the hand a bright, dark-eyed little boy, perhaps a
year younger than herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mamma!” cried little Virgie, all excitement, “I
have had such a lovely time down stairs on the veranda.
There was the nicest lady and gentleman there, and this
is their little boy. We played a long time with some
beautiful white stones, and we had some caramels and
taffy, the lady told us some pretty stories, and Willie’s
papa sang us such a funny song; then they went away
for a walk, and told Willie that he might come and play
with me for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Something made Virgie grow very pale and still while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her child was talking; something in those dark eyes of
the little stranger, lifted in wonder and inquiry to her
beautiful, white face, made her shrink and tremble, a
terrible suspicion in her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stooped quickly and looked closer into the small,
upturned face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your name is Willie,” she said, in a low, repressed
tone—“Willie what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Willie Heath,” he answered, regarding her earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mamma, and he lives away over the sea, in England—away
over that water where poor papa went
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dear,” said Virgie, interrupting her, and though
she had known well enough, the moment she saw him,
who the child was, the sound of those two names smote
her with such startling force that she reeled dizzily and
was obliged to lay hold of the door for support.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor mamma! your head is bad again, isn’t it?”
said her little girl, taking her hand and lifting it tenderly
to her lips, while she looked pitifully into her white
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, darling, and I shall have to lie down again; but
you and your little friend may come in if you like,” she
forced herself to say, as she feebly made her way to a
lounge, and almost fell upon it, a deadly faintness nearly
overpowering her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, mamma; we will go out into the hall and play,”
Virgie replied, while the young stranger regarded the
stricken woman with wide, grave eyes. “I am going to
get that box of toys that you bought me yesterday, then
Willie and I will go away, and we will not make any
noise, so you can sleep. Does your mamma ever have
such dreadful headaches?” she asked of the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“No, but papa does sometimes; then he has to stay in
a dark room, and everybody has to keep as still as mice,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to the suffering woman as if she could not
suppress a moan of agony to hear the child call that man
“papa,” and she wondered if he ever knew what it was
to have such a heartache as she was at that moment
suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Virgie secured her box of playthings, and then
the two children tiptoed out of the room, softly shutting
the door after them, while Virgie lay another hour trying
to compose herself and rally her shattered nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>She arose at last with the fixed determination to have
one look at the man and woman whom she believed had
ruined her life—just one glance to see how life had dealt
with them, and then she would fly from all danger and
temptation.</p>

<p class='c007'>She arrayed herself in a lovely dress of black lace, made
over rich lavender silk, and looped here and there with
glistening ribbons of the same color. She had coiled her
abundant hair in a coronet about her shapely head and
pinned it with a golden arrow, in which there gleamed a
single diamond. Her ornaments were of dead rough gold,
fashioned in some quaint design, and she fastened in her
belt a cluster of white acacia blossoms, which made a
lovely contrast against the black and lavender of her
dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was exquisitely beautiful, and she realized the
fact as she finished her toilet, and she could not help
wondering what she—that other woman was like—the
woman who had won her husband from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could hear the merry voices of the children, who
were still at their play in the hall, and a bitter smile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>curled her lips as she thought how unconscious they were
of each other’s identity, or of the torture she was suffering
to have them thus together, two rivals, she believed,
for the same name and inheritance.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a little she went to her door and looked out at
them. The children were both seated upon the floor, with
Virgie’s toys between them, and were chatting gayly with
all the unconscious freedom of childhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mamma, you are better!” cried Virgie, catching
sight of her mother, her face lighting with pleasure, “and
how nice you look! Willie,” turning with an impressive
air to her companion, “do you know I think <em>my</em> mamma
is the prettiest mamma there is in the world; yours is very
nice and grand, but I <em>don’t</em> think she is quite as lovely
as mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy fixed his eyes on Virgie, and looked gravely
thoughtful for a moment, as if debating the point in his
mind, and she was amused, in spite of her pain, by his
evident desire to be guilty of no disloyalty, and yet not
wound his new friend by contradicting her assertion, as
he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, perhaps; but my <em>papa</em> is very handsome. Where
is your papa?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sh!” Virgie whispered, as her mother turned quickly
away at the question and walked to the end of the corridor,
where there was an alcove inclosed by rich draperies,
“it makes mamma very sad to say anything about my
papa. We lost him when I was a little baby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he went away over the same sea that you had
to cross and he never came back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! he was drownded!” whispered the little fellow,
in an awe-stricken voice, and looking exceedingly shocked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“What is your mamma’s name?” he asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virginia—the same as mine. What is yours?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Margaret, and it means ‘a pearl.’ Papa sometimes
calls her his ‘pearl of great price.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” moaned Virgie from behind the draperies, as
she caught these words, “a pearl of great price, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then a door midway of the corridor opened and
another lady came slowly down the lofty hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was tall and commanding in figure; not so slight or
graceful as Virgie, but possessing a sweet and gracious
dignity that was exceedingly pleasing.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a perfect blonde, and her beautiful golden
hair was gathered into a massive and graceful knot at the
back of her head. Her eyes were blue, her cheeks delicately
tinted with pink, and a rare, winning smile played
about her sweet mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was dressed all in white. A robe of some soft
clinging material was <i><span lang="fr">en traine</span></i>, very artistically draped
and elaborately trimmed with a profusion of white satin
ribbons. She wore an elegant set of opals surrounded
with diamonds, and was truly a beautiful and distinguished
looking woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face gleamed with infinite tenderness as she drew
near the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, are you still playing together?” she asked, as
she stopped beside them; “you seem inclined to be very
friendly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Virgie is a very nice girl to play with,” returned
Master Heath, with the air of one paying a great compliment;
“and see what she has given me, mamma,” he
added, holding up a handful of toys.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Do not let the little girl rob herself,” said his mother,
in a voice of tender caution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; she made me take them; and—oh, mamma! I
have seen her mamma—she was here just now—such a
lovely lady! And Virgie says she lost her papa when she
was a little baby—he was drownded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drowned, you mean, Willie,” corrected the lady;
“how sad! but perhaps you ought not to talk about it,
dear,” she added tenderly, as she bent forward and softly
stroked Virgie’s glossy hair with her jeweled hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were tears in her eyes as she said it, and though
Virgie, in her hiding place behind the draperies, could
not see these, she could hear the slight tremulousness in
her tones, and she knew that she was a tender-hearted,
sympathetic woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>She then began to talk about something else and thus
led their minds away from the sad topic until in a few
moments they were laughing in the merriest manner—the
childish voices ringing out fresh and clear, that of the
beautiful woman like a silver bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie saw and heard all with the keenest pain in her
heart and though a torturing jealousy filled her soul—a
sense of wrong and humiliation—from the belief that
another had supplanted her in the heart and home of the
man she loved, yet she could but own the worth, the
beauty, and the fascination of that sweet, womanly
woman who seemed so unconscious of wrong, whose
heart was so full of tenderness and sympathy for the
sorrows of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, if, as she stood behind those curtains peering out
upon that merry, attractive group, she could have known
how very near she was just then to happiness and an
explanation of all the dark past, she never would have
concealed herself as she did. She would have made herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>known; she would have sought rather than shunned
that beautiful woman in white, and learned the mistake
that had so embittered the last ten years of her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she could more resolutely have faced a wild beast
than those pure, innocent eyes and that happy smile. At
first she had thought that she would go down to dinner,
she would assert herself and make her presence a
living reproach to the guilty pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now she knew she could not; her strength would
fail her, and she only longed for an opportunity to steal
away unobserved to her room and hide her wretchedness
once more from every human eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned away from that pretty tableau where her
darling was so happy, and gazed out upon the street beneath
her; but she saw nothing, heard nothing, for the
tumult within her heart and brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was conscious of nothing else till a movement almost
beside her caused her to turn suddenly, and she
found herself face to face with William Heath’s wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said the latter, flushing slightly
as she met the startled, surprised look that shot into Virgie’s
eyes; “I did not know that any one was here. I
came to find a book that I left here yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie bowed, and moved aside to see if she was hiding
it; but her heart beat almost suffocatingly, and she
was as white as that cluster of acacias in her belt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, there was a volume lying on the chair beside her,
which Mrs. Heath recognized, remarking as she took
possession of it:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes, this is it. Thank you; I am sorry to have
intruded upon you.” Then, with an upward, admiring
glance into the beautiful face, she added: “Pray, excuse
me, but are not you the mother of the little girl who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>playing with my son in the corridor? The resemblance
between you is very striking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Virgie is my daughter,” Virgie answered, laying
an unconscious stress upon the pronoun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a dear little thing—so merry, yet so gentle and
affectionate,” remarked Mrs. Heath, with a tender inflection
which somewhat softened her listener, “and I believe
she is the loveliest child I ever saw. How old is she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She was nine in June.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And my boy is eight,” smiled the fond mother, with a
proud, backward glance; “and he seems to have become
really attached to Virgie during the little time
they have played together. Have you been in Niagara
long, Mrs. Alexander?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie started at being thus addressed by the woman
who bore the name which had once been rightly her own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We arrived the day before yesterday,” she said,
briefly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! So recently?” replied her companion, wondering
why the beautiful woman should be so reserved. “Then
you have had no opportunity to see the attractions of the
place, and it is wonderful here. I have never seen anything
so grand in all Europe as these mighty falls and the
rapids.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was so sweet and gracious, and evidently so desirous
of pleasing, that Virgie was seized with an impulse to
show her the better side of her character. She felt sure
that they would meet again some day when, perhaps, their
relative positions might be reversed, and something like
a feeling of pity for the lovely woman prompted her to
put aside her pain, her jealousy and bitterness, and exert
herself to be agreeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>She responded cordially to the remarks she had just
made relative to the scenery of that locality, and thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>once launched, she talked as she had never talked before—of
nature, of art, of literature, of men, and things generally;
and when, half an hour later, the two women separated,
Mrs. Heath was fascinated, almost enraptured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have never met any one so brilliant or beautiful
before,” she murmured to herself, as she went to call her
boy from his play, remarking that he must bid his little
friend “good-by, since papa had decided that they were
to leave directly after dinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several hours later, as the twilight had begun to deepen,
Virgie, weak and pale from the excitement of the day,
sat upon the balcony opening from her room, eagerly
watching a little scene below.</p>

<p class='c007'>A carriage had just been driven to the door. Two large
trunks were brought out from the hotel and strapped
upon it, then a gentleman and a lady with a little boy
and maid followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie crouched down behind the railing and strained
her eyes for a look at that tall, manly figure, firmly believing
it to be Sir William Heath—her recreant husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood by the carriage door and assisted his wife to
enter with affectionate care, seeing that she was perfectly
comfortable before he attended to anything else; then he
caught his boy in his arms, and with some playful remark,
which the eager ear above could not catch, tossed him
lightly in beside his mother. Then the maid was kindly
assisted, after which he entered himself, and the travelers
were driven away.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Virgie, with all her anxiety to do so, had not been
able to catch even one glimpse of that face. There was
something familiar about the form, although it was
somewhat stouter than Sir William had been ten years
ago, while he had spoken so low that she could not tell
whether it was the old loved voice or not; but as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>carriage was whirled away in the growing dusk she
felt a hundred-fold more desolate than ever before.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were so happy, she so miserable! Why, oh, why
must such things be?</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a different mood took possession of her, and she
grew hard and stern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is coming—a day of retribution will surely come,”
she said. “There may be a son to inherit the title, but, if
he told me the truth, the eldest born inherits the bulk of
the property, and Virgie shall yet have her inheritance.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a great relief to Virgie to know that the Heaths
were gone, for now she would be perfectly free from all
restraint and could go about as much as she desired without
the fear of encountering them.</p>

<p class='c007'>She remained a fortnight at the falls, visiting every
place of interest in the vicinity, and making many beautiful
sketches. Then she turned her face westward and
northward, following the great lakes, intending to see
much of the scenery of Michigan and Wisconsin before
her season of travel should end.</p>

<p class='c007'>She traveled very leisurely, never hurrying from place
to place, for she strove to get all the enjoyment possible
out of her tours, both for herself and her little girl, who
was never happier than when journeying in this easy
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But once they were obliged to ride all night. It was
not often that Virgie would allow herself to do this, for
they could not rest well upon the cars, but in this instance
it seemed to be necessary in order to make connections.</p>

<p class='c007'>She retired early for the sake of little Virgie, who was
nervous at being on the train at night, they taking the
lower berth of their section, while the maid occupied the
upper one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie was very weary and soon dropped asleep without
a thought of danger or of the terrible tragedy that
was so soon to send a score of those thoughtless travelers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>into eternity, maim as many more for life, and stamp
every memory with a never-to-be-forgotten horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie did not know how long she had slept, when she
became conscious of several heavy thuds against the bottom
of the car she was in, accompanied by violent jerks
and wrenches, and a swaying from side to side; then it
seemed as if they were being thrown into space; there was
one awful moment of horror and suspense, then a terrible
crash, mingled with shrieks, and groans, and prayers;
after that darkness and oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she came to herself again it was to find her little
daughter clinging to her in an agony of terror, calling
piteously to her to “wake up and take her out of that
dreadful place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She tried to sit up, but found that she could not, there
was barely space between her own and the upper berth to
admit of her moving at all. To make the situation even
more appalling it was as dark as Erebus, while the cries
for help and the shrieks of pain all around her filled her
with a sickening horror, and she knew there had been a
dreadful disaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you hurt, darling?” she asked, an agony of dread
at her heart, and her relief was almost as intense when
the reply came:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, mamma, only so frightened by the dreadful
noises.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie had not removed her clothing, simply loosened
it, and now it was the work of but a moment or two to
gather her wraps about her, fold a shawl around Virgie
and help her from the berth, though she found
great difficulty in standing erect, for the car had been
thrown partly upon its side.</p>

<p class='c007'>She called to her maid; but there was no reply, and,
fearing the worst for the poor girl, Virgie resolved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>get her darling out of danger and then return to see what
she could do for her unconscious servant.</p>

<p class='c007'>They worked their way out of the car with difficulty,
realizing as they did so that the portion where they had
been was the least shattered of any—that they had been
wonderfully preserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie emerged from the debris as well as she could,
and found herself in a swamp. She could now account
for that sensation of being thrown into space, and the
awful moment of suspense following before that terrible
crash had come; the train had been pitched from its roadbed,
she did not know how many feet above, and now lay
a mass of ruins in a bog or meadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>She bore Virgie to more solid ground, set her down
by some bushes, and then, throwing her own mantle over
her, bade her not move from that spot until she came
back to her again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! don’t go back again, mamma,” cried the child,
clinging to her in terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must, darling,” Virgie answered, firmly. “I cannot
leave Mina to die there. Be a brave little girl and do not
detain me. I will come back as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am afraid, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing can harm you now, dear; we are both safe,
thank God! while no one can tell how many have met
their doom and are dead or dying.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She bent down and kissed the child tenderly, thankfully,
and then sped back to the car, determined to know the
fate of her maid.</p>

<p class='c007'>All about her the direst confusion prevailed. Men were
hurrying hither and thither. Women were weeping and
moaning, and wandering about calling piteously for lost
ones, while children were screaming with fright and pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was lighter now, for two of the cars were burning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>having taken fire from overturned lamps, and Virgie
made her way more easily back into the sleeper she had
left.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mina! Mina!” she called, springing toward the berth
she occupied, and to her intense relief a muffled sound
came back in reply, and she knew that she was not dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found that the top of her car had been smashed in,
and the girl, thus pinioned to her berth, was half-suffocated
by the pressure from above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie never could tell afterward how she managed to
release her, but by dint of encouragement and commands
she succeeded in making the girl exert herself, and, using
all her own strength, she by degrees got her to the edge
of the berth and finally out of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you badly hurt Mina?” she asked, as she supported
the half-fainting girl, and wrapped a blanket
around her trembling form.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, marm, my left arm is dreadful,” the girl moaned,
and Virgie could feel that it hung limp and helplessly by
her side, and she knew it was broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we must hurry out of the car, for it is filling
with smoke, and I fear has taken fire somewhere,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were just turning to leave the place when, from
the very midst of the smoke there pealed forth a heartrending
shriek:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help! help! Will no one save me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie felt every nerve in her body creep at the sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, some poor creature is there, and will be burned to
death if help does not come. What shall we do?” she
cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clearly Mina could do nothing with her broken arm,
for she was moaning with every breath, and there was
no one else at hand; every one who was able had deserted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the car long since, and was either looking out for number
one or assisting others elsewhere; but Virgie felt that she
could not leave the sufferer, whoever it might be, to the
terrible fate of being burned to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>She helped Mina from the car, told her where she
would find little Virgie, and then she flew back to find the
origin of that pitiful cry for help.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you?” she called, as she groped her way
toward the spot from whence it had seemed to proceed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here. Oh! come quickly! I am almost suffocated!
I shall be burned alive!” was the agonized response, accompanied
by groans of pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a woman, Virgie knew by the tones, and all her
sympathies were instantly aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found her at last, and her heart sank within her as
she saw her condition, for the poor creature was wedged
between a demolished berth and the side of the car in such
a way that it seemed impossible to rescue her.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a sickening sight, for, already, Virgie could see
little tongues of flame leaping up all about her and shooting
out toward her as if eager for their prey, while the
smoke was rapidly growing denser.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman saw it, too, and her face was almost convulsed
with agony and fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, do help me,” she prayed. “I shall be burned. I
cannot die such a horrible death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie felt that she was powerless—she knew that she
could not so much as stir that mass of debris.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go and call some one,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no! You shall not leave me,” screamed the
woman, frantic with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam,” Virgie returned, calmly but firmly, “it is
impossible for me to do anything for you unaided. The
best I can do will be to go for help; but first tell me who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>you are in case anything should happen to you before I
can return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am Lady Linton. I live in Hampshire County, England,
and am just on a visit to this country with my son
and daughter, and some other friends, who are now awaiting
me in Chicago. Now go—go and save me if you
can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be difficult to portray with what stunning
force these sentences fell upon the ears of Virginia Alexander.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart almost ceased beating, while a thousand
thoughts went flashing with lightning-like rapidity
through her brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had recently avoided a meeting as she supposed,
with Sir William Heath; and had now encountered in this
marvelous way his sister—the woman who had written
those cruel letters to Mrs. Farnum so many years ago,
but which were still stamped upon her brain so indelibly
that she could repeat them word for word. This was the
woman who had scorned her claims upon her brother—who
had heartlessly advised her to “settle in some place
where she was not known and try to bring up her child in
a respectable way,” who had insulted her by sending her
a hundred pounds to soothe her disappointment for the
loss of her husband and because she could not be recognized
as the mistress of Heathdale; and now she lay
crushed beneath a mass of ruins, doomed to a dreadful
death unless the very woman she had so wronged and
mocked should strain every effort to save her. It was
truly a strange fate that placed her thus in the power of
Virgie.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant an evil spirit took possession of her heart
and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“She helped to ruin my life; she mocked and scoffed
at my misery, and she ought to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next moment she called out in clear, resolute
tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will save you! have courage—do not fear,” and she
almost flew over the debris, through the gathering smoke
and out of the car, where she seized a man by the arm
and cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with me; a woman is helplessly pinned down
inside this car; it is on fire, and she will soon be burned
to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dragged him almost by main force into the burning
wreck, and made her way back to the spot where she
had left her suffering foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can never get her out of there—ten men couldn’t do
it before we should all perish,” said her companion, when
he saw her situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <em>must</em>! I tell you she <em>shall</em> be saved!” Virgie cried,
almost savagely, and, seizing hold of one of the fallen
timbers in her excitement, she gave it a wrench which
told, and showed that it was not impossible as it had first
appeared to rescue the unhappy victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus inspired and encouraged, the man braced himself
and pulled with all his might at the berth in which the
woman lay. It yielded; they knew they would save her.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fearful shriek rent the air; then all was still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! pull her out. I can brace this beam for a moment,”
Virgie cried, and calling all her strength and will
to her aid, she did actually brace herself against one of
those heavy timbers, holding it back, until the man
dragged the unfortunate woman from her perilous situation,
and then, gathering her all unconscious, in his arms,
he staggered out of the now rapidly burning car,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>closely followed by Virgie, who had barely strength
enough left to reach the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lend a hand here, somebody,” cried her companion,
and three or four helpers sprang forward to relieve him
of his burden, when he turned and caught the brave
woman, who had risked her own life to save that of an
enemy, just as her strength failed her and she would
have fallen senseless, back into the burning wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account of her heroism flew from lip to lip, and
many willing hands were stretched forth to minister to her.
Restoratives were brought, a physician was called to attend
her, and it was not many minutes before she rallied,
although she was as weak as a little child from the terrible
strain during those last few moments in the burning
car.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she refused all attention now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not suffer—I am uninjured; I am only temporarily
exhausted. Go to those who need you,” she said,
and creeping to the spot where she had left her child, she
gathered her close in her arms and burst into a passion
of thankful tears—thankful, not only because they had
been spared unharmed to each other, but because she had
been enabled to obey the divine mandate “Do good unto
them which hate you,” and though Lady Linton might
never know <em>who</em> had saved her—might never experience
an atom of gratitude to her whom she had wronged, yet
<em>she</em> would always have the blessed consciousness of evil
resisted and a noble action performed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 id='V' class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>VIRGIE BECOMES A NURSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Three cars of that night train had been literally dashed
in pieces, two more had been partially demolished, and
only two baggage cars and the engine remained uninjured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twenty passengers had been killed outright, several
were so badly injured that their death was only a question
of time, and many were crippled for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a shocking casualty, and even those who escaped
unhurt were so badly shaken up and so unnerved by the
sight of the dead, the dying, and the sufferings of the
wounded, that they dropped exhausted and almost helpless
the moment the necessity for action was over, and
all who could be removed had been taken out of the
wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disaster had been caused by a broken rail on a
bridge that spanned a small stream. The wrench and
strain of the first car, as it was thrown from the track,
had snapped the iron arch, the whole structure had then
given away, and most of the train had been precipitated
into the meadow below, with the fearful results already
described.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sleeper, in which Virgie had been traveling, was
the least shattered of any, and most of the frightened
passengers had escaped from it as soon as possible after
it touched the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>One man affirmed that he went back afterward to ascertain
if any one remained in the car, but there had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>no response to his shout, he could see nothing, for all the
lights had been extinguished, there had been no cries
or groans, and believing that everybody had succeeded
in getting out, he went elsewhere to render assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was supposed, and rightly, that Virgie, with her maid
and child, and Lady Linton, must have been stunned by
the shock of going over the embankment, and did not
recover consciousness until all others had left the wreck,
and thus, had it not been for the brave woman’s energy
and perseverance, they might have been left there to
perish.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had recovered sufficiently to look after the
comfort of her small family, she found poor Mina suffering
extremely, her arm having been broken in two places,
while she was otherwise badly bruised; and little Virgie,
although she had escaped without even a scratch, had become
almost frantic with terror on account of her mother’s
swoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a small village not far from the scene of
the disaster, and to this the sufferers were borne, the
kind-hearted people cheerfully throwing open their homes
to them and offering whatever they had to make them
comfortable, and their services also as nurses. Medical
and surgical assistance was immediately summoned, and
the whole place immediately became a veritable hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mina’s needs were among the first to be attended to,
and she bore the operation of having the broken bones
set with much fortitude and patience.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that was over she became comparatively comfortable,
although Virgie hovered about her all day, ministering
to her as tenderly as if she had been a sister,
sparing neither her own strength nor expense to alleviate
her sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>But toward evening, when she had fallen into a heavy
sleep, produced by an anodyne, and little Virgie, wearied
out with excitement and the trying scenes that she had
witnessed during the day, had begged to be put to bed,
Virgie bethought herself of other sufferers and went out
to ascertain if she could be of assistance elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her first inquiry was for Lady Linton, who, she found,
had been carried to a neighboring cottage and was reported
as very seriously injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made her way thither, and was told that, although
there were no bones broken, it was feared the lady had
suffered some internal injury which might prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been unconscious most of the day, but now
she was lying in a heavy sleep that almost amounted to
stupor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie asked the weary woman who told her this, if she
could be of any assistance, and she replied that if she
could come in and sit awhile with the sick lady it would
give her a chance to get her husband’s supper and put
her house in order; she had neglected everything to attend
to the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie willingly complied, and passing quietly into the
sick-room, she sat down by the bed and looked upon her
husband’s sister, her heart filled with the strangest
emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>She saw that she slightly resembled Sir William, although
she was a good many years older and not nearly
so attractive. This, however, might be owing somewhat
to her injuries, for there were several bruises about her
head and face; she looked haggard and worn; her hair
was in disorder and thin and quite gray; one hand had
been badly cut and lay bandaged upon a pillow beside
her, and truly she was a pitiable object in her present
condition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>For long years Virgie had entertained hard and bitter
feelings toward this woman. She did not, of course,
know the extent of the wrong of which she had been
guilty, but she had never forgotten Lady Linton’s arrogance,
nor the scorn which she had expressed regarding
her to Mrs. Farnum; still, as she now lay there before
her, so helpless and miserable, she could feel only compassion
and regret for her. Something of the divine
nature always animates the heart and begets a certain
tenderness for those whom we benefit, particularly if some
signal sacrifice has been made to secure it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat there beside the unconscious woman for an
hour or more, changing the wet cloths on her bruised
head and gently fanning her, for the room was far from
airy or comfortable, although it was the best in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the physician came in, and Virgie questioned
him regarding Lady Linton’s condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not tell just yet how serious her injuries
were, he told her. They might not prove to be anything
alarming, but her nervous system had undoubtedly suffered
a severe shock which might prove to be worse than
any hurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know her?” he asked, in conclusion, while his
keen eyes searched Virgie’s beautiful face curiously. He
had heard something of the heroism which she had shown
that morning in saving the woman’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know who she is,” she replied. “Her name is Lady
Linton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum! English, then,” interrupted the doctor, with a
quick glance at the figure on the bed. “Any friends in
this country?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She mentioned that she was on her way to Chicago to
meet her son and daughter, and some other friends, but
I do not know their address.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Where is her home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With her brother, Sir William Heath, in Hampshire
County, England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie flushed scarlet as she spoke this name which
she had not uttered before in years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She ought to have some friends here to care for her,
but he is so far away it would be useless to send for him,
at least until we know more about her condition. Was
she traveling entirely alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I judge so. She spoke of no one being with her when
she was found.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You found her; you saved her. I heard about it,”
said the doctor, his face glowing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went for assistance,” Virgie returned, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did much more than that, madam. Did you
escape unhurt?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Entirely, and my little daughter also, for which I cannot
be too grateful. My maid, however, has a broken
arm, besides several bruises; but she is very comfortable,
and requires but little attention, so if I can make myself
useful by caring for any others who are suffering, I shall
be more than glad to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The physician thought a moment, and then asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever had any experience in a sick-room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. My father was an invalid many months before
his death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you might do good service here, if you are
willing to devote yourself to this case under my direction.
There’s only one woman in the house. She cannot,
of course, give her whole time to nursing, and this
lady will need close watching and a great deal of attention
during the next two or three days. Indeed
she really needs someone who can be depended upon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie flushed again.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>It was very strange, she thought, that she, of all persons,
should be commissioned to care for Lady Linton
at such a critical time.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she did not hesitate; it was her duty to do what
she could for her, without regard to her own personal
feelings in the matter; her enemy was like the Levite
who had been left wounded by the wayside, and it
now fell to her to act the good Samaritan’s part.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” she answered, quietly, “then you may
consider that I am at your service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor looked relieved, and after giving her
minute instructions for the night, he went his way to
other patients, confident that he could not leave the
sufferer in better hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the woman of the house was at liberty
again, Virgie went back to see if Mina was comfortable,
and to arrange for someone to wait upon her
if she should need it during the night, and then she
returned to her charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was very little change in Lady Linton’s
condition during the next two days. She slept most of
the time, only rousing to take the nourishment that
was almost forced upon her, and then sinking into that
death-like stupor again.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the third day she awoke and began to manifest
some interest in her condition and surroundings,
and seemed to remember all that had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, after a thorough examination, it was ascertained
that her injuries was not nearly so serious as
had at first been feared. There was a severe contusion
on one side, where the broken timbers of the car
had pinned her down to the floor; she had several
ugly scratches and flesh wounds, besides bruises on
the head, and one ankle was badly sprained. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>stupor, as the physician thought, had been caused
more by the shock to the whole nervous system than
by her injuries, and he now said that if no new
symptoms developed she would improve rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it proved even so. At the end of a week she
was able to be bolstered up in bed, and began to appear
more like herself and to realize that she had another
lease of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had conceived a great liking for Virgie, although
she had not been told, neither had she recognized the
fact that she had saved her from death at the time of
the accident. She treated her with the greatest deference—an
unusual thing for the haughty woman under
any circumstances—and expressed a great deal
of gratitude for the attention she so freely bestowed
upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once she had begged to be told her name, and Virgie
had told her to call her “nurse.” She shrank from
telling her who she was lest she should recognize
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are not a nurse, you are a lady,” she persisted,
“and you are so kind to me I want to know
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie could not fail to feel a thrill of triumph at
these words, she, who had been “that girl” and who
had been held up to such scorn and contempt in those
cruel letters so long ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am simply your nurse for the present,” she replied,
with averted face; “perhaps some other time before
I leave you I will tell you my name,” and her
ladyship had to be content with that.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Virgie did not remain quite so much with her
after that, she did not need such constant care, and
she left her more with the woman of the house. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>went in several times every day, and was careful to
see that she had every attention, but there was a quiet
dignity and reserve about her which Lady Linton admired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is this beautiful woman who has been so
kind to me—to whom I owe so much?” she asked the
doctor one day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly she is a beautiful woman, and you do owe
her a great deal. You owe her your life twice over,”
he answered, impressively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How so?” was the surprised query.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the first place she saved you from that burning
wreck almost at the risk of her own life; in the second
place she is the only one in the town who could
be found to give you proper care; everybody else
was engaged with the other sufferers, and during those
days and nights when you lay in that heavy stupor,
she never left you; she fed you, she ministered most
faithfully to your every need, and brought you safely
out of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was it she who came to me when I lay pinned
down in my berth?” asked Lady Linton, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am obliged to confess that I do not know her
name,” the doctor admitted, smiling. “I doubt if she
knows mine either. We have not stopped to exchange
cards in this business; it has been of too serious a
nature to admit of much ceremony. I call her
‘madam,’ and she has, naturally, addressed me as ‘doctor.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She seems a thorough lady,” said his patient,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had, as Sir William once told her she would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>changed her ideas somewhat regarding American people
since coming to this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are right, madam,” replied the physician, emphatically.
“It has never been my privilege to meet
a more cultured lady nor a truer woman. I shall certainly
ask her to favor me with her name and address
before she leaves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is she going away?” demanded Lady Linton,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; in a day or two, I believe; her maid is doing
nicely now and able to travel. But, bless me, I must
not sit chattering here when there are more than forty
patients waiting for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the brisk little doctor trotted off, leaving
Lady Linton looking very thoughtful, and wondering
who her mysterious but beautiful nurse might be.</p>

  <h2 id='VI' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>“I AM THE WOMAN YOUR BROTHER LOVED.”</span></h2>

<p class='c006'>The morning after the foregoing conversation between
Lady Linton and her physician, Virgie went in
to see the invalid, taking her daughter with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had come to take leave of her ladyship, for they
were going away to some quiet resort for a few weeks,
for Mina’s sake, and after that home to New York.
She brought Virgie as a sort of shield from embarrassment,
for she dreaded any effusions of gratitude from
the woman who, she felt sure, would hate her even
now, in spite of all she had done for her, for having
won her brother’s love; while, too, she had a curiosity
to see if she would be attracted toward her child; she
was a believer in the old adage that “blood is thicker
than water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The invalid’s face lighted the moment the door
opened to admit her kind attendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so glad to see you,” she cried, heartily; then
her glance fell upon the beautiful child, and she added,
with evident delight: “And you have brought your
little daughter with you! Come here, dear, and let me
see if you are as lovely as your mamma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She held out both hands to her and the little one
went composedly forward and stood before her, her
dark eyes searching the woman’s face with a look
that thrilled her strangely, while she was deeply impressed
with her wonderful beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very like your mamma,” said Lady Linton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>smiling down upon the sweet child; “all excepting
your eyes. I rather imagine that those came
from papa. What is your name, dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her ladyship started slightly and glanced quickly
at the child’s mother, and something that she saw in
that beautiful countenance made her grow suddenly
pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her mind went back to that morning when her
brother had laid before her several photographs of
his lovely wife, and she was almost sure—even though
she had never looked upon them since—that there
was a resemblance between that face and this; and
the child’s name was the same, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no; it could not be; and she banished the suspicion
from her as quickly as it came. It was only a
“singular coincidence,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie,” she repeated, trying, but in vain, to resume
her light tone, “I suppose that stands for Virginia.
Well, my little maiden, do you know how
kind your mother has been to me while I have been
so ill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma is always kind to everybody,” was the
grave response, and Virgie wondered to see her in
this strange, self-contained mood. She was usually
very free and confiding with every one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a loyal-hearted little girl!” laughed Lady
Linton; “how thankful I am that you were spared for
her and she to you from that dreadful accident. Your
papa, too, must be a very happy man to know that
both his treasures are safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t any papa.” said Virgie, with a soft
little sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>A painful thrill shot through Lady Linton’s nerves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>at this, and she darted another look at the child’s
mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very strange! She wore no widow’s weeds,
she was not even in black! Instead, she was looking
very lovely in her stylish traveling suit of dark gray,
with a knot of pale blue ribbon at her throat and another
in her hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed,” the mother interrupted, not liking
to have the child questioned further, “we are very
grateful for having escaped such danger. We came
to tell you that we are going away to-day, though I
would gladly remain, if I could be of use to anyone,
and duty did not call me elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-day!” exclaimed Lady Linton, in surprise. “I
shall be very sorry to part with you,” and her under
lip quivered, for at that instant she thought of the
debt she owed the beautiful woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie bowed. She was laboring under a fearful
constraint. She would gladly have avoided this last
interview, but something that impelled her to come,
if for nothing more than to let her ladyship see her
brother’s child, even though she was unconscious of
the relationship existing between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is your maid doing well?” Lady Linton inquired,
after a somewhat awkward pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks; yes, much better than I had hoped she
would. She feels quite able to travel, is rather homesick,
and longs to get away from this dreary place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a lonely place. I, too, shall be glad to rejoin
my friends. I expect someone will come to me to-morrow,
and the physician thinks that by the end of
another week, I may also be able to get away. Oh,
must you go?” the invalid concluded, regretfully, as
Virgie arose to leave.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Yes, my carriage will come for us in half an hour,”
she replied, glancing at her watch. “I am glad to
leave you so comfortable, and I trust nothing will
occur to retard your full recovery—that your visit to
this country may not be spoiled by this accident.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton looked up astonished, as these cold,
measured words fell upon her ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie had not meant to speak so frigidly, but her
ladyship’s reference to her “friends” made her surmise
instantly that she was speaking of her brother
and his family, whom she believed she had seen at
Niagara, and it was with the greatest difficulty that
she could control herself at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely you are not going to leave me thus?” said
the sick woman, reproachfully, “without even allowing
me to clasp your hand; you, who have done so
much for me, who have twice saved my life. Come
here and let me kiss you good-by—let me tell you
that I shall never cease to think of you with gratitude
and love. Why, you have never yet told me your
name! You must not go without telling me who you
are, so that I can inform my brother and friends who
was my deliverer from a dreadful death—who was
my kind nurse during my critical illness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie was as pale as a marble statue now; she
could bear no more, and she resolved that she would
tell her the truth. She should tell her brother,
any anyone else she chose, who had saved her, if she
wished to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Run away, Virgie, and help Mina to get ready,”
she said to her daughter, “and I will come presently;”
then, as the child obeyed, she turned back, and
stood tall and straight before the woman who had
wronged her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Lady Linton,” she began, in low, intense tones that
smote her like a whip, and made her shiver with
dread at what might follow, “it is true, I suppose,
that I saved your life at the time of the disaster: it
is true, also, that I have tried to make you comfortable
during your illness; but I have not done it to win
your gratitude or to oppress you with any sense of
obligation. I did it, first, from a sense of duty, as I
would have performed the same service for any
stranger in trouble; and, second, because I would
not allow myself to turn coldly from you in the hour
of danger and distress, because of a feeling of enmity
toward you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enmity?” interrupted her listener, with pale lips,
and putting out her hand as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, enmity, for my heart was full of it when you
told me who you were. If I had listened to the evil
that surged through my brain on that dreadful night,
if I had yielded to a spirit of revenge for past injuries,
I should have turned my back upon you when you
called upon me to save you, telling myself that you
deserved no better fate. But I believe I am a Christian,
a disciple of One who commanded us to ‘love
our enemies, to do good to those who despitefully use
us,’ and I wished to conquer that enmity, to subdue
myself, to return good for evil; and that is why I
tried to save you then, and afterward served you as
tenderly as I would have served my own mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—why! what are you saying? I do not understand,”
incoherently cried the startled woman, as she
gazed wildly into that beautiful face before her, and
began to realize something of the terrible truth yet
to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not mean that you should understand,” Virgie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>resumed, speaking more gravely. “I did not
mean that you should ever know to whom you owed
your life. I meant to do what good I could for you,
and then go quietly away, taking with me as my only
reward, the consciousness of a duty faithfully performed.
I do not know why I have spoken thus even
now, but the words seemed forced from me by a
power beyond my control. Perhaps it is because you
asked me to kiss you, to clasp your hand in friendly
farewell, when I was conscious that you would wish
me to do neither, if you knew who I am, that you
would shrink from me, repel me, perhaps even hate
me more than you have ever done. I see that you
begin to realize who I am. Yes. I am Virginia
Alexander, the woman whom your brother once loved,
for I believe even now that he did love me then—and
who worshiped him, who would have devoted her life
to his happiness, and considered herself blessed in so
doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton had fallen back upon her pillow as
Virgie uttered that well remembered name, and now
lay, as if transfixed, gazing upon her with a look of
amazement mingled with something of terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>A suspicion of the truth began to dawn upon her
when the child had told her name; it had been
strengthened when she had so innocently said she had
no papa, and it was now confirmed by Virgie’s open
declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The knowledge almost paralyzed her; she could
neither move nor speak; she had no power but to
stare with a helpless, appalled look at that perfect
figure, that pale, beautiful, high-bred face, as she
realized, at last, the enormity of the wrong of which
she had been guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“You have seen my little daughter,” Virgie resumed,
after a moment, with a tender, even pathetic
inflection; “she is also your brother’s child, and the
heiress of Heathdale——</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does that offend you?” she asked, as Lady Linton
shrank again, as if from a blow, at these words. “It
is to be regretted, but it is a fact which nothing can
change, and she will one day claim her own, even
though her mother is no longer the wife of her
father, and I trust that she will then do honor to the
name and position which she will assume. You may
rest assured that I shall attend most faithfully to her
education, for it has been, and still shall be, my chief
object in life to make her worthy in every way to be
received as a representative of the ‘ancient and honored
house of Heath.’ Pardon me if I seem ironical,”
Virgie interposed, a slight smile flitting over her lips
as she quoted this sentence, which had been burned
into her brain so long ago; “but I cannot forget the
cruel things which you wrote to your friend, Mrs.
Farnum, ten years ago. Do you blame me for refusing
to clasp, in pretended friendship, the hand that penned
them? or for shrinking from the kisses of one who so
scorned and mocked me; who offered me money, as if
my honor was a thing to be bought, my wretchedness
and despair something to be alleviated with gold?
You wrote of me is ‘that person’—‘that girl,’ as if I
belonged to a lower order of humanity; but, madam,
my grandmother was an English woman like yourself,
and perchance—though I assume nothing of the
kind—there is as good blood in my veins as in your
own. But,” with a weary sigh, “perhaps I am wrong
to recriminate thus. I had no intention of saying
aught like this when I came to you. I am afraid I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>have been inconsiderate of your weakness, but my
words have come unbidden. I wish you no ill. I think
I have proved that during the past week. I wish your
brother no ill, if he is happy in his present relation;
far be it from me to wish him to suffer as I have suffered,
although he has done me the greatest wrong
it is possible for a man to do a woman. It is a strange
freak of fate, Lady Linton, this meeting between you
and me, and yet I believe I do not regret that we have
seen and known each other; it has served to show
you what the woman, whom your brother wooed and
won, is like; that although she may not have belonged
to the titled aristocracy of a kingdom, she was at least
a true-hearted daughter of a grand republic, and in
no way his inferior in character or intellect. We may
never meet again, and we may; I cannot tell; but
some day the wrong that has been done me will be
righted through the justice which must and shall be
rendered to my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As she ceased Virgie bowed gravely and then
turned and quietly left the room, leaving Lady Linton
more astonished and browbeaten—though it had been
done in the most courteous and dignified way imaginable—than
she had ever been before. For several
minutes she sat staring, in a dazed way, at the door
which had been so softly shut upon that graceful, retreating
form, and almost feeling as if the whole interview
must have been some hallucination of the
brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>That lovely woman—proud, beautiful, cultivated—with
that magnificent form and carriage, the “low-born
girl!” whom she supposed her brother had married!
It seemed impossible! She was so entirely different
from what she had conceived her to be.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Why, this brilliant creature was fitted to grace a
throne—to shine a star in the highest circles of even
her own country, of which she was so arrogantly
proud, and she, by her cunning plotting, her falsehood
and calumny, had debarred her from her home, from
all the rights which legally belonged to her; she had
brought shame and dishonor upon her, broken her
heart, and, in so doing, had made her own brother’s
home desolate, his life almost a barren waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>That beautiful child, too—that dainty, graceful,
golden-haired fairy, with her mother’s delicate features
and her father’s eyes; yes, they were strikingly
like Sir William’s own—she had tried to cheat her
out of her heritage, and thus the grand old house at
Heathdale was childless and was likely to remain so
until this brave, determined woman came to demand
justice, and to claim for her daughter the respect and
honor that had been denied her as a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that she would do it if she lived; those
quiet, resolute tones still rang in her ears, and she fell
back upon her pillows weak and faint, heart-sick and
terrified, and, for the moment, filled with remorse for
the sin of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>She fully realized at last the enormity of her treachery
and wickedness—the hardness of her heart, the
selfishness of her nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been utterly heartless when she had attempted
to crush the lovely girl whom her brother
had won, and now the basely wronged woman had
turned and heaped coals of fire upon her head. She
had nobly put aside all sense of injury, and, knowing
full well that she was serving an enemy, had saved
her life and then given her kindest attention and tenderest
care during her illness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Lady Linton knew that she should carry a burdened
heart to her grave on account of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fired with sudden impulse, she started up and
sharply rang her bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman of the house came to her almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is she?” demanded the invalid, wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who?” asked her attendant, surprised by her excessive
agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The lady who has been so kind to me. Call her
back! Call her at once!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has gone. The carriage has just driven away
from the cottage where she stopped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton sank back again with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was too late. She had meant to do a good
deed. Under the impulse of the moment, and with
a feeling of gratitude animating her, overcome with
admiration for a rarely beautiful woman, and a sense
of superiority; with the vision of that lovely, dark-eyed
child still before her, she had resolved to make
a full confession of all her wrong-doing, try to effect
a reconciliation between those two who, she knew,
still devotedly loved each other, and thus atone, as
far as was possible, for the sin she had committed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the opportunity was gone, and when she came
to think of it more calmly afterward, she began to upbraid
herself for her momentary weakness, and to be
glad that she had not committed herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her good angel fled, her better nature was overcome,
and she grew harder, more bitter than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be some way out of it,” she muttered,
as she recalled Virgie’s threat to claim her child’s
heritage. “I will fight it out to the bitter end. I am
glad I did not make a fool of myself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>AFTER EIGHT YEARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Eight years have passed since Lady Linton, with
her son and daughter, her cousin William Heath, and
his family, visited America; since she so nearly fell
a victim to that railway disaster, and was rescued
by a woman whom she had hated, whom she now
hated a hundred-fold.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a beautiful winter morning, and in the sunny,
elegantly appointed dining-room at Heathdale an interesting
group of five persons is gathered around the
bountifully spread breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one end sits Sir William Heath, a handsome, dignified
gentleman a little above forty, yet hardly looking
that, for the fleeting years have touched him but
lightly, in spite of the great sorrow which has lain
so heavily upon his heart and robbed his life and his
home of its chief joys—the love and presence of a
fond, true wife, the patter of little feet, and the happy
laughter and merry chatter of childish voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opposite him, and engaged in serving coffee, is his
sister, Lady Linton, who has changed greatly during
the last eight years. She has grown old and wrinkled,
and her face has hardened, if that could be possible.
There is a cynical expression about her thin mouth,
and her eyes are cold and critical in their expression,
excepting when they rest upon her children, who now
sit beside her, one at her right, the other at her left
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Percy Linton had done credit to the promise of his
youth, and is a fine young man of twenty-one, honest,
noble, and thoughtful beyond his years. He is lately
home from Oxford, where he achieved great honors,
and is now planning to return to the neglected and
impoverished estate which has father’s prodigality
nearly ruined, with the intention of reclaiming it and
restoring it to something of the thrift and prosperity
for which it was noted under the care of his grandfather,
for whom he is named, and whose mantle seems
to have fallen upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mother is not at all in sympathy with these plans.
She wishes her son to adopt a public career. She still
has strong hopes that he will fall heir to her brother’s
title and property, in which case there would be no
need of his spending the best years of his life in striving
to redeem a heavily-mortgaged estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William, however, heartily approves of his noble
resolve, and promises to assist him in every possible
way, and, with this encouragement, he has decided to
devote himself to Linton Grange.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian Linton is a brilliant and beautiful girl of
nineteen. She is a clear brunette, with a lovely bloom
on her cheeks, vividly red lips, dark eyes and hair.
Her features are delicate and regular; she is tall and
finely formed, attractive in manner, but in disposition
and temperament she is much like her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining individual of the group was Rupert
Hamilton, Sir William Heath’s ward, and the child
of his dear friend, Major Hamilton, who died several
years ago. He is now a young man of twenty, tall
and stalwart in form, with a well-shaped head set
proudly upon a pair of square, broad shoulders. He
has a handsome and intelligent face, with a pair of full,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>wine-brown eyes, which always meet yours with a
clear, steady gaze, that proclaims a noble character
and a clear conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>His nose is something after the Roman type, his
mouth firm and strong, yet when he smiles, as sweet
and expressive as a woman’s. One would know at a
glance that he was true and generous, kind and genial.</p>

<p class='c007'>One could perceive also that Sir William loved
him like a son by the affectionate glances which he
bent upon him, by his answering smile whenever
their eyes met, and the confidential tone which he used
when addressing him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young heir to half a million pounds thought
his guardian the noblest man in the world, and he
would have deemed no service too difficult or disagreeable
to perform for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew something of the trouble of his early life,
that he had been married and parted from his wife,
although he had never heard her name spoken, or
asked a single question upon the subject, and he had
always felt a peculiar tenderness and sympathy for
him on this account.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact of Sir William’s marriage was no longer a
secret, although Lady Linton had tried every way to
conceal it. It was not very generally known, however,
even now; but in his own household and among
his intimate friends it was understood that he had
married a beautiful woman while on his first visit to
America, and that some cruel misunderstanding had
resulted in a separation. He had insisted upon this
explanation, for hope was not yet quite dead in his
heart that some time he might find Virgie, effect a
reconciliation, and bring her home to Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who knew that he was free to marry again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>if he chose, sometimes urged him to do so and not
allow his name to become extinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he always replied, with a heavy sigh:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a wife already, and some time, please
Heaven, I shall find her. No other shall ever be mistress
of Heathdale while I live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This reply never failed to arouse the fiercest anger
in Lady Linton, who grew more bitter with every year
toward the woman whom she had wronged, and who
had repaid her injuries with such kindness and Christian
charity to her everlasting shame and humiliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Wife,’ indeed!” she once retorted. “A woman who
divorced herself from you in the way she did, coolly
severing the bonds, which you seem still to hold in
such reverence, is not worthy the name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I loved her, Miriam—I love her still; I shall
be true to her till I die,” her brother answered. “Our
separation has been the strangest thing in the world—it
is wholly incomprehensible to me; but if I ever find
we have been the victims of treachery, let the
enemy who has meddled beware!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Twice during these last eight years he had crossed
the Atlantic and renewed his search for Virgie, but
without obtaining the least clew of her whereabouts,
and so he returned again to his home.</p>

<p class='c007'>He never intruded his sorrow upon any one; indeed
his life flowed along so calmly and smoothly that a
stranger might have supposed that he had remained
single from choice, although there was a wistful sadness
in his eyes that impressed every one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of late he had interested himself considerably in
politics and been in Parliament, having been returned
for his borough several times.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return to the breakfast table, from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>we have roved, and where an animated discussion
was in progress, together with the disposition of the
many tempting viands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure I do not know what I am going to do
without you during the next six months, Rupert,”
Sir William remarked. “Here I was anticipating
having you all to myself for awhile, after you got
through school, and now you want to go roving the
first thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do want to see a little of the world I live in,
I confess, before I choose my profession; and you
have told me so many interesting things about America,
and American people, that I have a curiosity to
see the country and mingle with the people myself.
Why can’t you come with me, Uncle Will? then we
need not be separated,” concluded the young man,
wishfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should be glad to, my boy, but my time and attention
will have to be given to the interests of the
borough for this year,” responded his guardian. “The
troubles in Ireland, too, bid fair to be pretty serious,
and every true-hearted Englishman ought to give
careful thought to the questions that are arising in
connection with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope that I am a true-hearted Englishman, but
since I cannot cast my vote until next year, I presume
you will not consider me disloyal for running
away for a little while,” Rupert said, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed, I want you to go, since you desire it
so much, and, considering all things, this is the best
time for you to go. Let me see; it is a Raymond excursion
to California that you have decided to join
after reaching New York, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, the circular which Raymond has issued is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>attractive I could not resist it. I feel sure that by joining
this party I shall see more of the country, in less
time and to better advantage, than I could to travel by
myself and lay out my own route.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you be with a large party, Rupert?” Lillian
asked, her color deepening and a rather anxious expression
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian Linton had learned to love Rupert Hamilton
with a strong and passionate affection, and this
attachment had been most unwisely fostered by her
mother, who was still determined that her idolized
daughter should marry her brother’s wealthy young
ward, and the heir to still greater prosperity and
honor, if it was possible to accomplish it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know how large the party will be, Lillian;
probably there will be quite a number in it,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, I judge not from some hints that are given
regarding the equipments necessary for the journey;
for articles which only ladies require are mentioned in
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian lost some of her brilliant color, and her eyes
drooped at this reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But do you like the idea of mingling so freely with
strange people?” she asked, with a slight curl of her
red lips. “Americans too,” she added, slightingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Lillian, are you so prejudiced against our
neighbors over the sea?” exclaimed the young man, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl shrugged her graceful shoulders and arched
her pretty brows, but deigned no reply. The act, however,
expressed far better than words could have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her contempt for the people of whom they had been
speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Percy glanced up at her with a roguish twinkle in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rupert will doubtless meet some fair damsel
among his party whose bright eyes and charming
smiles will prove too much for his susceptible nature,
and, before we know it, our loyal Englishman will
have forsworn his colors and joined the great republic,”
he said, to tantalize his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Percy, how little faith you have in me,”
laughed Rupert. “Of course I expect there will be
some fair damsels in my party, but doubtless they
will be so closely guarded by jealous parents and vigilant
chaperons that no young man of my age will have
an opportunity to play the agreeable to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither of the young men observed the spasm
of pain that contracted Sir William’s brow at these
remarks, nor the hardening of Lady Linton’s face, as
they thought of that episode in the life of the former,
some eighteen years previous, while he was traveling
in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust that Rupert will not be beguiled into any
discretions, no matter how attractive the ladies of
his party may be; he owes it to his self-respect to
choose his wife from his own countrywomen,” remarked
her ladyship, with a swift glance at her daughter,
whose eyes were fixed upon her plate, as if she
had no interest in anything but the morsel that
she was diligently reducing to mince-meat with her
knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are the ladies of America more artful in that respect
than those of any other nationality, Lady Linton?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>asked the young man, innocently, but with a
quizzical smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am happy to say that I know but very little
about them, but what I do know has not served to
prepossess me in their favor,” was the sharp retort
of her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miriam, I will trouble you for another cup of coffee,”
said Sir William, quietly, but in a tone which
warned his sister that she had better not pursue the
conversation further on that line.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned to his nephew, with a genial smile,
saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I only wish Percy had not been in quite such a
hurry to settle at the Grange; I would really like to
have you run over to the United States with Rupert
for a little holiday before you begin work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Uncle Will; but, truly, I feel that it
would not be right to take either the time or the
money for such a journey. My duty plainly points
to the earliest possible restoration of my fallen house,”
the young man answered, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish that every young man possessed as conscientious
a regard for duty as you do, Percy. I
confess I honor you for your desire to clear the
Grange of all incumbrance, though I would gladly
be your banker if you would consent to accompany
Rupert.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have already been my banker to such an
extent that I do not feel willing to draw upon you
any more. I am very grateful for all your kindness,
Uncle Will, but indeed my self-respect demands that
I should begin to depend upon my own exertions; so
I shall wed myself to the home of my ancestors until
every debt is paid and the glory of the days of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>grandfather is restored,” Percy concluded, smilingly,
but with a firmness which plainly told that his mind
was made up regarding the course he was to
pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I consider it a senseless, quixotic notion; I think
you had much better sell the place and realize what
you can from it, rather than spend the best of your
life in trying to pay debts that other people have
contracted,” said his mother, resentfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sell Linton Grange,” exclaimed the young man,
aghast. “Why, mother, where is your loyalty to the
home of more than a dozen generations?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have suffered too much at Linton Grange to feel
very much loyalty for bundles of mortgages, promissory
notes, etc.,” retorted Lady Linton, a deep flush
suffusing her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Percy is right, Miriam, so do not try to discourage
him. It would, indeed, be a pity to sacrifice such
a grand old place, while there was the least hope of
reclaiming it. It will, no doubt, be up-hill work for
the first few years, but, with the spirit which animates
him, I am sure he will succeed, and his reward
will be sweet,” Sir William said, heartily, as he arose
from the table. Then turning to his nephew, he continued:
“I will ride over to the Grange with you in
a couple of hours, and we will consider further the
measures you proposed to me yesterday.”</p>

  <h2 id='VIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>A GLIMPSE AT LILLIAN LINTON’S HEART.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Rupert, have you seen my orchids since they
bloomed?” Lillian asked of her uncle’s ward, as the
family were leaving the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Are you indulging in orchids, Lillian?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I am wild over them. Uncle Will gave me
several varieties on my last birthday, and they are
just doing their best for me now. Come into the conservatory
and let me show them to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. I have a fancy for the pretty things,
too,” replied the young man as he followed the fair
girl toward the hot-house, and thinking, as he did so,
how lovely and graceful the girl was in her perfectly
fitting morning robe of garnet cashmere trimmed with
swansdown, and which harmonized delightfully with
her brilliant complexion.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took him to a sunny corner of the conservatory
which Sir William had set apart and fitted up expressly
to gratify this extravagant whim of his pretty
niece, and where the young lady had really displayed
much taste and appreciation of the rare things in
which she was interested, both as to choice and arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>They spent half an hour or more in examining the
beautiful things, and Rupert became almost as enthusiastic
as Lillian herself over them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she had no notion of allowing even her favorite
flowers to monopolize all his attention. She had had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>a far more important object in view in bringing him
there with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you are really determined on taking this American
trip, Rupert?” she remarked, as they paused before
a lovely arethusa in full bloom, from which she
broke its fairest blossom, and, bending forward, fastened
it to the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Lillian, what a pity to break the pretty thing!”
he said, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not for you,” she answered, looking up at him
with a smile, and flushing as she met those frank
brown eyes that were regarding her with unmistakable
admiration. “You would be welcome to more if
you wished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very generous,” he returned, regarding the
flower thoughtfully, and wondering what made her
blush so when with him. “But about my trip. Yes,
I have decided that I will go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sail just a week from to-day. I wrote yesterday
to engage my passage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So soon?” Lillian cried, catching her breath, and
losing all her brilliant color.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; if I am to join that excursion to the Pacific
coast on the 12th of next month, I must be off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The house will seem like a convent when you are
gone; you are the life and soul of everything here,”
said the girl, tears starting to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; I had no idea that I was of so much
importance,” he returned, lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you?” she asked, sweeping him a coy look
from beneath her long, dark lashes. “You have something
to learn yet, then. But how long will you be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>away? Surely not six months, as Uncle Will said this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I think so. I do not wish to hurry, and I
mean to get a pretty thorough idea of what the United
States are like. I think I shall be away until July or
August.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Rupert, don’t! It will be too lonely and
wretched for anything without you!” Lillian burst
forth, impetuously, and in an agitated voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Lillian!” he exclaimed, astonished, and bestowing
a puzzled look upon her downcast, agitated
countenance; “will you miss me like that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you expect you could go away for so long
and not be missed?” she asked, tremulously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I confess I had not thought much about it,” he replied,
gravely; “but I suppose, as we have all been
brought up together, and had so much in common, that
no one of us could go away without being missed.
However, you will have Percy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Percy is soon to go to the Grange, and will
be so taken up with his interests there that we shall
see but very little of him. Oh, Rupert, I wish there
was no such place as America!” Lillian concluded, with
quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless you, little sister! I never thought that my
going away would upset you like this,” Rupert said,
laying his hand lightly on her shoulder, and really
moved to see how she was taking it to heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little sister!” she repeated, flushing crimson, and
drawing her figure to its full height.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was very handsome at that moment, and Rupert
wondered that he had not noticed of late how exceedingly
lovely she had grown, while there was a nameless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>something in her expressive face, and even in her
attitude, that thrilled him strangely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does that offend your young ladyship?” he questioned,
laughing. “You are not so little after all, and
I was unfortunate in my choice of an adjective; but
you were such a tiny midget when I came here, eight
years ago, that I have always regarded you as very
<i><span lang="fr">petite</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am not—your sister; we are not related at
all,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started, and bent a puzzled look upon her. She
was standing before him, with half-averted face, her
darkly fringed lids almost touching her cheeks, her
bosom heaving with the heavy pulsations of her
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True,” he returned, in a constrained tone, “and
you must pardon me if I have presumed too far; but
you must understand, Lillian, that it has become a
natural consequence for me to regard you almost in
that light, since one cannot live so many years in a
family without becoming strongly attached to its
members. I had flattered myself, too, that I had won
at least a little corner in the hearts of my friends
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have! you have! Oh, Rupert, I did not mean
anything like that!” Lillian cried, in a distressed tone,
and with visible agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what did you mean? I do not understand
you,” the young man asked, and leaned forward to
look into her downcast face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian lifted her great dark eyes to his for an instant,
and his heart gave a startled bound at what he
read in their dusky depths. Then the rich blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>rushed in a crimson flood to her very brow, dyeing
even her white neck with its rosy hue.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment a door of the conservatory opened
and shut, and the girl started guiltily from his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There comes the gardener,” she said, with evident
confusion, “and I must speak to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She darted away, speeding swiftly down the walk,
leaving the young man speechless and amazed at the
discovery that he had made; for he had read in the
girl’s beautiful face and speaking glance the confession
of her love for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whew!” he ejaculated, recovering himself after a
moment; “I never dreamed of anything like that!
What in the world have I been thinking of not to
realize before that she had grown a young lady, and
a very beautiful one, too? I wonder if I could—can
it be possible that I have—bah! I never have meant
to do any mischief in that way. Perhaps I’ll—no.
I’ll wait until I get back from my trip. It is very
awkward. I wish it had not happened just now,” he
soliloquized, brokenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood gazing out of the conservatory in an absent
way for several minutes, his face very grave, an
anxious look in his fine eyes; but, as he heard Lillian
and the gardener approaching, he passed around to another
path and so out of the hot-house, and thus avoided
meeting them; he did not feel that he could encounter
the young girl again just then. He wished
to get away by himself and think over the revelation
he had just received.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thought of love in connection with Lillian Linton
had never entered his mind until now.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had simply been a genial playmate during the
earlier years of his life, sharing many of his own and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Percy’s sports, and a pleasant companion when, of
late, he had returned to Heathdale from college to
spend his vacations.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had scarcely realized—as his own words betrayed—that
she had reached woman’s estate. He
knew she was very pretty, very bright and sparkling;
he knew that Heathdale would not seem like home to
him without her, and he enjoyed her society as he
would that of a dear sister; but as for anything nearer,
as a wife, he had never thought of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>More and more he regretted that little episode in
the conservatory. The memory of it embarrassed him,
try hard as he would to overcome it, and he found
himself avoiding the possibility of a <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> with
Lillian again, while he began to grow anxious for the
day of his departure, that he might escape the unnatural
constraint that seemed to have fallen upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William wondered what had come over him during
the next few days, but attributed his unusual gravity to
his regret at the approaching separation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton knew from Lillian’s manner, that something
had gone wrong; but, although she questioned her,
she could learn nothing satisfactory, and she became more
and more unreconciled over Rupert’s projected tour.</p>

<p class='c007'>If she could only have succeeded in arranging an engagement
between him and Lillian before he left, she
would have felt quite safe in letting him go; he would
have stood committed then, and it would have been a
safeguard during his absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did everything in her power to make it pleasant
for him during the little time that remained to him at
home; she meant that he should at least take away agreeable
memories with him, and he assured her again and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>again that he should never forget her kindness to him,
for all that she was doing for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have been like a mother to me, Lady Linton,
ever since I came to Heathdale,” he said, gratefully, to
her one day when she was arranging something for his
comfort during the voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you have been like a son to me, my dear boy,” she
returned, with a fond glance. “I shall always regard you
as such. I am sure I do not know what we are going to
do without you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six months will soon pass,” Rupert said, trying to
speak lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They may to you, who will be traveling constantly,
but they will be long to us who wait at home. Poor
Lillian! I set her to marking some handkerchiefs for
you this morning, but she broke down and cried so over
her work that she had to give it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid I am an unworthy subject for so much
regret,” Rupert said, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian’s regard for him, her pale, sad face, and hollow
eyes, were a great burden on his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day of his departure arrived, and he took an affectionate
leave of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton embraced him as fervently as if he had
indeed been her son, bade him take care of himself and
come safely back to them, for it would break their hearts
to lose him entirely. Percy wished him every possible
pleasure, and promised to write to him every week.
Lillian gave him an icy cold hand at parting; there were
tears on her dark lashes, and her lips quivered painfully
over her farewell; but she would not allow him to kiss
her in the old friendly fashion, as he used to do when
he and Percy went back to school at the end of their holidays.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>She had vowed that their lips should never meet
again until he had given her a lover’s kiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert looked troubled at being thus repulsed. He
understood the reason for it, however, and it was with a
feeling of relief that he realized he was to have six
months in which to make up his mind as to what his duty
was toward his guardian’s niece.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William accompanied him to London, thence to
Liverpool, where he saw him safely on board the stanch
Cunarder that was to bear him across the Atlantic, after
which he returned to Heathdale, feeling as if half the
sunshine had suddenly been blotted from his life. The
boy was inexpressibly dear to him, and he would have been
bereaved indeed if anything happened to him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>A STRANGE MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The voyage was a tempestuous one, but the steamer
made her time notwithstanding, and Rupert landed
in New York eight days after leaving Liverpool, and
was not sorry to be once more upon <i><span lang="la">terra firma</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>He joined the Raymond party on the twelfth of
January, according to his plans, and found himself
among a very pleasant company of gentlemen and
ladies, young men and maidens, all enthusiastic in
view of their trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was particularly attracted by the appearance of
one young man, who, like himself, was traveling
alone, and after one or two interviews, being mutually
pleased with each other, they decided to become traveling
companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the third day after starting Rupert’s new friend,
who, by the way, had introduced himself as Harry
Webster, remarked to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say, Hamilton, have you noticed that dainty
little piece of humanity opposite, who is traveling
with that old codger, Mr. Knight, they call him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; she is a very attractive young lady,” Rupert
answered, as his eyes wandered to a trio who occupied
seats a little in front of the young men on the
opposite side of the car. “I wonder who she is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our list will probably tell us,” remarked Mr. Webster,
as he drew the card from his pocket. “Yes, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>have found it. Mr. Robert G. Knight, Miss E. F.
Knight, and Miss Virginia Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, then the old gentleman and lady must be
brother and sister, and the young lady some friend,
perhaps a niece, who is traveling with them,” said
Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old gentleman appears to be remarkably fond
of her though,” returned Mr. Webster.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but the old lady keeps guard over her as if
she feared that some brigand was in ambush, waiting
to abduct her pretty charge to regions unknown,”
Rupert responded with a roguish twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you say to making a raid upon the party?”
proposed his companion. “Now I am bent upon getting
acquainted with that pretty girl, if for nothing
more than to show that prim spinster that I can do it.
Will you join me, or does such a proposition shock
your English ideas of etiquette?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I confess I should prefer to have a formal introduction,”
Rupert returned, flushing slightly, but regarding
that graceful figure with a look of unmistakable
admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maiden whom the young men had been discussing
was indeed a very lovely girl, about eighteen
years of age. She was a trifle above the medium
height, having a slender, willowy figure, with a peculiar
grace and animation in every movement. Her
glossy brown hair was twisted into a shining coil
at the back of her head, which was crowned with a
pretty hat of gray felt, trimmed with velvet of the
same shade and a single scarlet wing. She wore a
closely fitting ulster, trimmed with fur, which showed
her perfect form to great advantage; a plain linen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>collar was fastened at her throat with a brooch of
dull red gold, and tiny ornaments of the same metal
were in her small ears. Her eyes were a dark brown,
and quick and restless in their glances; her features
were beautifully clear and delicate; the glow of perfect
health was on her cheeks; her lips were a vivid
red and her complexion very pure.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a vivacious little body, laughing and chatting
with the elderly gentleman, in whose charge she
appeared to be, in a way that betrayed she stood in
no fear of him, while his fond glances and the many
attentions he bestowed upon her plainly betrayed that
he was indeed very fond of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Webster had been especially attracted toward
this party from the hour of starting, and had been on
the alert to make their acquaintance, although he had
not mentioned the subject before; but the trio had
kept pretty well by themselves and appeared quite contented
with their own company, so, as yet, there had
been no opportunity for him to approach them without
making himself conspicuous in so doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in spite of his boast that he would make Miss
Alexander’s acquaintance, he was destined to be outdone
and thrown into the background by his more
modest English friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the party was summoned to dinner that day
there was the usual rush for the dining-car; human
nature will not always be curbed when people are
hungry; but Mr. Knight and his companions lingered
to avoid the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Webster also delayed, and held his friend back
in the hope that something might occur to establish an
acquaintance with the young lady whom he so much
admired.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>And something did occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>In passing from one car to the other, Mr. Knight
first assisted his sister across, then turned to his young
charge, when a gust of wind whirled her pretty hat
from her head, it being held in place only by a pin,
and it would have been wafted beyond recovery but
for Rupert, who was directly behind her, and who
deftly caught it in its flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>He instantly returned it to its fair owner, saying,
with a bow and his frank smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad that I was quick enough to save
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad, too,” returned the little lady, with a
merry  laugh. “Thank you. It would be very awkward
to have to go on my way bare-headed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert glanced at her as she restored the hat to its
place with a look which plainly said that he thought
it a very pretty head, even in that state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight politely acknowledged his obligations
for the service; but his sister, who was looking over
his shoulder, regarded the two young men askance,
as if she was not quite sure that the occurrence had
not been all a plot, to which old Boreas had craftily
lent his aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they all passed into the dining-room car, where
there was one small table unoccupied, with space for
four persons, with only one other vacancy at another,
midway of the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight turned to Rupert, saying, cordially:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come and share our table—I see the others are
nearly full—and let me introduce you to my sister and
ward. What shall I call you, if you please?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert drew forth a card, and handed it to the gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Ah, Mr. Hamilton. My name is Knight. This
lady,” turning to the spinster, “is my sister, and this
gay young woman,” with a fond glance into the pretty
face beside him, “to whom you have just rendered so
signal a service, allow me to introduce as Miss Alexander,
Mr. Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young couple acknowledged the introduction,
though with heightened color, and then Mr. Knight
motioned them to their seats, while Mr. Webster, feeling
somewhat chagrined to find that he was being
left in the lurch, hastened on to the vacant place farther
down, giving his friend a comical glance of recognized
defeat as he passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert found his new acquaintances very delightful
people. Even the spinster, whom he and Webster had
laughingly pronounced a “female ogre,” proved to be
a lady of rare culture and an exceedingly entertaining
companion. He was seated beside her, consequently
his conversation was mostly with her, although
Miss Alexander was his <i><span lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i>, and he found
it almost impossible to keep his eyes away from her
dimpled, expressive face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are you enjoying your journey thus far, Mr.
Hamilton?” Mr. Knight inquired, during the meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very much, thank you, although I have no doubt I
should enjoy it much better if I were not quite such
a stranger to the party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are all strangers for that matter,” returned the
elder gentleman. “I have noticed that you and your
young friend keep much by yourselves; but you must
stir about and get acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One does not like to intrude upon family parties,”
Rupert replied, modestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must not stand upon formality. I have tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to impress that upon my sister here, who is a trifle
shy about making new acquaintances; but in such a
company as this we all expect to become acquainted
with each other, and we shall enjoy our trip much
better than to be ceremonious. At all events, I have
broken the ice for you; I find it pleasant to have young
people about me, and shall be glad to know you better.
Eh, Virgie, it has been a little lonely, hasn’t it, to
have only two old fogies to talk to?” and Mr. Knight
turned, with a roguish twinkle in his eyes, to the fair
maiden at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young girl shot a quick glance at Rupert, a
charming smile wreathing her red lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then her cheeks began to dimple and her eyes to
gleam with mirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know of one ‘old fogy’ who is fishing for a compliment,”
she retorted, with a saucy toss of her bright
head, “and who has been speaking two words for himself
and one for others. I know what he wants. Mr.
Hamilton, do you play whist? Because if you do,”
she went on, archly, without waiting for him to reply,
“and are fond of it, it will be all right; for you
will doubtless be invited by my guardian to ‘take a
hand,’ and once committed, look out for yourself; he
is an inveterate player, and he has no mercy on his
foes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, fie! Virgie, what a character to give your best
friend; and to a stranger, too,” laughed Mr. Knight,
good-humoredly; “but I confess I am a dear lover
of whist, Mr. Hamilton, and”—with a quizical look
at Virgie—“if you know the game, won’t you and
your friend take a hand, after dinner, with me and
my ward? My sister does not play.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“There! I told you so,” interposed the gay girl,
with a ripple of silvery laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert joined her heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you for your timely warning, Miss Alexander,”
he said, “but I do understand the game and
like it, too; but before I commit myself, won’t you tell
me, please, is your friend a very formidable antagonist?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dreadful! he plays as if his life and honor depended
upon his winning every game,” she answered, the dimples
playing at hide and seek about her lovely mouth,
while Rupert thought her the most delightful little
body he had ever met.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then perhaps you may know some of the weak
points of the enemy, and will join me in besieging his
fort after dinner,” he said, with an appealing glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; I will, with pleasure, Mr. Hamilton,”
was the gay response; “it is not often that I play
against him; but if I could see him beaten a few
times, just to take some of what our Irish neighbors
call ‘the consate’ out of him, I think I should rather
enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! the depravity of human nature!” cried Mr.
Knight, in mock distress, though his eyes rested very
tenderly upon the bright face beside him; “after sharing
all my honors in the past, to forswear your allegiance
like this! it is rank treason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not be disheartened, my dear guardian,” laughed
Virgie, “for perhaps you have it in your power to
punish me severely for my presumption in taking up
arms against you; however, Mr. Hamilton, we will do
our best to come off victorious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they returned to the palace car, Rupert introduced
his friend, and then the quartet gave themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>up to the enjoyment of their cards, Miss Knight occupying
a seat in another section, and burying herself
in a book.</p>

<p class='c007'>They played for two or three hours, and to Miss
Virgie’s great glee, she and her partner beat the others
three games out of five.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight accepted his defeat very good-naturedly,
but declared that he would be even with them some
other time, and then he fell into conversation with
his new acquaintances upon the topics of the day, while
Virgie sat by and listened, and studied the two young
men in whose society she had been so unexpectedly
thrown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course we all recognize in Mr. Knight the great
publisher, who had been so kind to Mrs. Alexander,
in San Francisco, during her many trials there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beautiful girl who is traveling with him is her
daughter, Virgie, who, when we last saw her at Niagara,
was but ten years of age. She is now eighteen,
and blossoming into lovely womanhood, and as charming
and winsome a maiden as one could find, go the
world over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her home for a number of years had been in New
York city, her mother, as we know, having changed her
residence at the time that Mr. Knight decided to come
East to establish himself in business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander had used her pen during all this
time, giving her friend one or two little gems of art
every year, for it was a pleasant pastime for her to
employ herself in this way, but her chief thought had
been given to the education of her daughter, who
proved to be bright and intelligent beyond the average
nineteenth century girl. She had graduated from one
of the select schools of the city during the summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>just passed, and her mother had begun to contemplate
taking her abroad when spring should come again, with
the intention of demanding her right at Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still, as the time gradually drew nearer, she had
shrunk more and more from the task before her, until
the constant dread of it had begun to affect her health,
and she had been far from well during the last few
months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight and his sister had never visited San
Francisco since leaving that city, although they had
often talked of doing so. But this winter, when they
learned of the Raymond excursion to that and other
points on the Pacific coast, they proposed to join it,
and invited Mrs. Alexander and her daughter to accompany
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not feel equal to either the weariness or the
excitement of the journey; but she thought that it
would be a good opportunity for Virgie to visit the
far West, and she gladly confided her to the care of
her friends for the two months that the trip would
occupy, and thus we find her in company with Mr.
and Mrs. Knight, bound for the State where her
mother had been born, and as fate had strangely ordered
it, with the very party which Sir William
Heath’s ward, Rupert Hamilton, had joined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 id='X' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>MR. AND MISS KNIGHT VERSUS CUPID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ice once broken between Mr. Knight’s party
and the two young men, the acquaintance progressed
rapidly, and it soon became evident that Rupert and
Virgie found each other especially congenial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young Englishman managed to constitute
himself the beautiful girl’s escort upon almost every
occasion when they were sight-seeing, until Mr.
Webster began to realize that he was <i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i>, or
as he humorously expressed it, but the “fifth wheel
to the coach,” and he was forced to look about him
for other society to soothe his wounded pride.</p>

<p class='c007'>He soon found it in the companionship of two
sisters, who were traveling with an aunt, and the
dark eyes and sparkling beauty of the elder ere long
bade fair to make as much a captive of him as Virgie
had already made of Rupert Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was the loveliest girl that he had ever seen.
Lillian Linton, and the startling discovery which Rupert
had made regarding her feelings toward himself
just before leaving Heathdale, were forgotten,
and he surrendered himself to the charm of her
society, never questioning to what it might lead,
or what his feelings might be when the trip was
ended, and they should go their different ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>But others began to consider these things if the
youthful couple did not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Older and more experienced eyes could see that
he was fast learning to love the charming girl, and
that she was also yielding her young heart, with its
first strong passion, to the handsome Englishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. and Miss Knight could not fail to perceive the
danger that lurked in the pleasant companionship,
and, while they liked the frank, manly fellow uncommonly
well, they were troubled at the thought of
anything serious growing out of it, while Virgie
was in their care.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Robert, I am afraid there is mischief brewing,
and I feel very uneasy about it,” Miss Knight remarked
to her brother one day, as Rupert and Virgie
stole away together to a corner of the parlor in the
hotel where they were stopping to look over a collection
of views, which the young man had recently
purchased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight shot a keen, anxious look at them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been a little fearful of it myself, Stella,” he
replied, gravely; “but I do not know as we can prevent
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must prevent it,” returned his sister, firmly.
“We must do our duty, Robert; it would not be right
to allow that dear child to become entangled in a
love affair while she is away from her mother. I
should never forgive myself, and she would never
forgive us, if any harm should befall her while she is
in our care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot think there is anything wrong about the
young chap,” returned Mr. Knight, his eyes resting
thoughtfully on the handsome face looking so smilingly
into Virgie’s; “he seems like a fine, manly fellow and has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>no bad habits; he does not even smoke, which is a
rare virtue among young men nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we know nothing about him or his family,”
persisted the lady; “we do not even know from what
portion of England he came; at least I do not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither do I,” said her brother; “I have never
questioned him and he seems very modest about talking
of himself; but if Virgie were my daughter—and
you know that I love her almost as well as if she
were—I do not think I should feel very much alarmed
to have her fall in love with as noble a specimen of
manhood as young Hamilton appears to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like him, too, Robert,” said Miss Knight; “he
is every inch a gentleman, and doubtless belongs to a
good family or he would not have been so carefully
reared. Still I am troubled; I want Virgie to go home
as free as she came, and—I feel as if young Hamilton
ought to be put upon his honor—at least until
we can give her back to her mother, when, of course,
our responsibility will cease. I can read the signs
of the times pretty well, if I have grown to be an old
woman, and, if we do not look out, they will be
acknowledged lovers before another fortnight goes
by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” he responded after a moment of silence,
“we shall not be together much longer. Hamilton
leaves this party as soon as we have done California
to go to Mexico with another company, so——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know that,” interrupted his sister, “and
that is just what is going to precipitate matters if
we are not on our guard. When the time comes for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>them to separate you do not suppose he will leave her
without begging for some word of hope?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stella, you reason remarkably well,” said Mr.
Knight, laughing, “and I think it will be best to put
a flea in the boy’s ear. I suppose it will be better
for me to get the name of being a meddlesome old
fogy rather than run any risk of future unhappiness
for our dear girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Knight appeared to be satisfied with this decision
of her brother, and dropped the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party was at San Jose when this conversation
occurred. They were to remain several days in the
beautiful city, making it their headquarters also while
visiting points of interest in its vicinity, and Mr.
Knight resolved to make a bold stroke at once at the
disagreeable task that his sister had imposed on him,
and have the matter off his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they were leaving the table of the Anjerais
House after dinner that evening he slipped his arm
within Rupert’s in a confidential way and said, with
a genial smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Hamilton, I am going out for a little quiet
stroll about the city; will you come with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert had been meditating a cozy <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> with
Virgie on the veranda, while the band discoursed
sweet music on the stand near by, but he was too well
bred and unselfish to refuse an old gentleman’s request,
and unhesitatingly responded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sir, I shall be happy to accompany
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were in the street Mr. Knight turned his
steps toward the park near by, and, after walking
up and down its beautiful avenues for a while, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>seated himself upon a rustic bench and motioned his
companion to sit beside him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned frankly to him, and, speaking with
great kindness, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My young friend, it has always been my practice,
when I had any disagreeable duty to perform, to adopt
the most straightforward course, and, as I have something
on my heart which I wish to say to you, I trust
that you will pardon me if I speak out freely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert Hamilton’s heart gave one tremendous
bound at these words, and he cast a startled look into
the friendly face beside him, knowing intuitively what
was coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I am in any way connected with this disagreeable
duty, sir, I hope you will speak frankly,” he managed
to stammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. I felt sure that you would receive
what I have to say in a friendly spirit,” Mr. Knight
continued, pitying the embarrassed lover sincerely.
“I am an old man, my boy, but I have been young and
do not forget the temptations and pleasures belonging
to youth; neither can I find it in my heart to blame
two charming people for recognizing a congenial
spirit, and turning to each other for companionship;
but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert Hamilton turned now, and looked squarely
into his aged friend’s countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In other words, sir, you wish to speak with me
regarding my admiration for Miss Alexander, which,
of course, I know you have not failed to remark,”
he said, in a manly, outspoken fashion, that pleased
Mr. Knight well, though a deep red flush mantled
his cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“You are right, that is just what I wish to confer
with you about,” the elder gentleman returned, adding,
“You will no doubt appreciate the responsibility
of my position, when I tell you that Miss Alexander is
the only child of a very dear friend, and the young
lady was intrusted to my own and my sister’s care,
during the journey, because her mother was not herself
able to accompany her. We therefore feel that
it would be very unwise and dishonorable on our part,
to allow her to receive, from any one, attentions
which might tend to hamper her future in any way.
For this reason, I wish to speak a word of caution to
you. Virgie is very young, and I do not believe
she has given a thought to what might result from
this pleasant intercourse, and I should deeply regret
it if she should become involved in any affair of the
heart while away from her mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are right, sir;” Rupert answered, gravely,
after a moment of thought, “and I thank you for your
timely admonition, else, in a moment of impulse, I
might have been led to betray more of my regard for
Miss Alexander than would be wise or right, under
the circumstances. I will deal as frankly with you,
as you have dealt with me, and confess that I admire
her more than any young lady I have ever met. She
is very lovely, and”—the flush on his handsome face
deepening—“were you her father instead of her temporary
guardian, I should boldly ask your permission
to address her with the hope of some day winning
her affection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight smiled upon the eager lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I imagine that I have spoken none too soon,” he
said. “I am afraid that sly little god, Cupid, has already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>wrought more mischief than I will be able to
remedy. But I admire your candor, Mr. Hamilton,
and if you desire a more intimate acquaintance with
my pretty little ward, by and by, I will give you her
address and you can seek her in her own home, where
there will be no ogre to rear obstacles in your path.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not call yourself hard names, Mr. Knight,”
Rupert said, regarding him with a look of profound
respect. “I am sure you have done only what you
believe to be right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; you may be assured that it was not an
agreeable duty,” returned the publisher, with a shrug
of his shoulders, adding, with a roguish twinkle in his
eyes, “and if Virgie were my daughter I think you
would not have found me a very obdurate parent.
Truly, young man, I like you exceedingly well, and
when we go back to New York, I will do all in my
power to favor your suit, if you are then of the same
mind as now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very kind, sir,” Rupert said, gratefully,
“and now, as I may not have another opportunity to
make the request, if you will give me Miss Alexander’s
address, I shall consider it a favor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight drew forth a card and wrote it for him,
wondering why he should speak as he had done
about not having another opportunity to get it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little later they returned to the hotel, where Rupert
at once sought the manager of the excursion,
and did not join the company again for an hour or
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then it seemed as if a change had come over him.
He was quiet and preoccupied, almost spiritless. Virgie
noticed it, and wondered what could have occurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to make him so. He did not devote himself
as exclusively as usual to her, although he was never
far away from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the party broke up for the night, after an
unusually merry evening, he went to her with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked up at him with shy eyes and a dimpling
smile, that almost made him break a resolve that he
had made since he last saw her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have not been like yourself this evening, Mr.
Hamilton,” she said. “Have you had bad news, or
are you not quite well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither, Miss Alexander,” he replied, looking down
upon her bright face with eyes that kindled and
glowed in spite of the restraint that he was imposing
on himself. “I am simply experiencing a good deal
of regret that I must leave some of my pleasant companions;
I am going to join a party for Mexico immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you?” Virgie asked, with a start, and looking
greatly surprised, while she lost some of her lovely
color.</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought it very singular that he had not before
mentioned the fact of his intention to leave at this
point. She knew that later on he was intending to go
farther South.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he said, his heart beating heavily, as he read
the regret in her eyes. “Some gentlemen have arranged
for an ocean trip, intending to touch at the
Santa Barbara Islands and land at San Diego, whence
they will proceed into Mexico. I am going with
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All the light had died out of Virgie’s face during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>this explanation. It seemed as if there was nothing
left for her to enjoy during the remainder of the
tour.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had never realized before how dependent for
enjoyment she had been upon his society, and now
he was going another way. Perhaps they would never
meet again; he would doubtless go directly back to
England after his return from Mexico, and that would
end this delightful episode of her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart cried out against the separation, and,
like a flash, it came to her how much this frank, noble
young Englishman had become to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not know what to say to him; she stood
there silent, wretched, and pale as the snowy lace
that lay in folds upon her white neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—have changed your plans quite suddenly,
have you not?” she at last managed to stammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is rather an unexpected move,” he tried to say,
in a natural tone; “but I may never have another
opportunity to take a voyage upon the Pacific Ocean,
and it seems best that I should go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have taken but very little more to have
broken the fair girl down entirely. In all her life
she had scarcely known a trial, hardly a wish ungratified,
and this had come upon her like a thunderbolt
from the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that she ought to make no sign before
him, and yet she could not repress all feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her lips quivered slightly and there was a wistful
expression in her eyes as she lifted them to him and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry that you are going, Mr. Hamilton.
We shall miss you sadly.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Shall you?” he cried, eagerly, his face growing
luminous. “Thank you,” he added, checking himself
again. “I am sorry, too, to leave you; but, Miss Alexander,
I shall be in New York early in the spring. May
I hope to renew our acquaintance there? May I come
to see you in your own home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A rosy glow leaped into the young girl’s face at this
request. A heavy load dropped from her heart, a
sweet, new hope began to bud within her soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed; do come, Mr. Hamilton. I know that
mamma will be glad to meet you,” she said, cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; but will you also be glad to see me,
Vir—Miss Alexander?” the young man asked, in a
low, eager tone, and there was an expression in his
eyes of which he was wholly unconscious, but which
told his fair companion much that he had fully intended
should remain hidden deep within his own
heart until he could stand before Mrs. Alexander, tell
her how tenderly he had learned to love her daughter,
and ask her sanction to his suit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I shall be glad,” Virgie breathed, softly, her
white lids hiding the happy light in her eyes, though
there was a tell-tale glow upon her cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one was approaching them and he knew he
must leave her, though she had never seemed so lovely
to him as in that shy, sweet mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I leave early to-morrow morning, therefore I must
say good-night and good-by now,” he said, trying to
smile as he extended his hand to her, though his voice
was a trifle unsteady.</p>

<p class='c007'>She laid hers within it and looked up archly, as she
replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not say good-by to you, Mr. Hamilton. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>do not like the words. I will bid you good speed,
wishing you a pleasant voyage and a safe return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His fingers closed over the small hand with a fond,
lingering clasp, then with one last look into her dear
face, he turned away, to make his adieus elsewhere,
knowing that he should not see her again for months,
but feeling as if his soul had quaffed some strangely
inspiring elixir during that last moment or two in
her sweet presence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It seemed very dull to Virgie for a while after the
departure of Rupert, who had been a very lively and
agreeable traveler; indeed, the whole company missed
him; but Mr. Knight and his sister exerted themselves
to fill the young man’s place as far as possible, and,
with the memory of that last interview, and the hope
of meeting him again in New York in the spring,
Virgie resolved not to pine, and gave herself up to the
hearty enjoyment of her sight-seeing and other pleasures
of the journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trip proved to be a most enjoyable one in every
way, and when Virgie returned to her mother, in
March, looking rosy and happy, and full of life and
enthusiasm over what she had recently seen, Mrs.
Alexander felt well repaid for the loneliness she had
experienced during this, their first separation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight told her confidentially of Rupert Hamilton
and his evident admiration for her charming
daughter, and warned her that she might look for the
young man’s return about the first or middle of May.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander was at first inclined to laugh over
the romantic episode, until her friend mentioned that
Rupert was an Englishman, whereupon she grew very
grave and sad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope they will never meet again,” she said,
sternly. “I do not want my child to marry an Englishman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>it is enough that her mother’s heart was
broken by one of that nationality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely, my friend, you do not imagine that all
Englishmen are knaves simply because one has proved
himself such?” said Mr. Knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I have no right to judge them so, yet I
have a prejudice against them that I cannot overcome,”
responded Mrs. Alexander, with a sigh. “I
hope my darling, if she ever marries, will become the
wife of a stanch American.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The young man is a noble specimen of his countrymen,
I can assure you,” Mr. Knight answered, anxious
to do Rupert justice. “I confess I should be rather
proud of him for a son-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander sighed heavily, and did not reply;
but she secretly resolved that if it was in her power
to prevent it, Virgie and her English admirer should
never meet again.</p>

<p class='c007'>April passed and May came, and Virgie began to
grow expectant. She was blooming into brighter
beauty with every day, and seemed to become more
womanly, so that her mother felt, with something
of sadness, that she no longer had her little girl, but a
lovely and winsome maiden, who would doubtless
soon be won from her sheltering care to grace the
home of another.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been a beautiful child, but she was far
lovelier now, possessing her mother’s refined and delicate
features and graceful figure, while her eyes were
so like her father’s that her mother often suffered
keenest pain as she looked into them, and seemed to
be gazing again through them into the heart of the
man whom she had loved so fondly in her youth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Of late she had pined anew for the affection which
had guarded her so tenderly in those early years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it was because her health had not been
as firm as usual during the last few months. She felt
weary and depressed. She longed for some one to
lean upon—some one strong and true to shield her
from the cares and worry of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every day, during the first two weeks of May, Virgie
watched for the coming of Rupert Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that he expected to return to New York
about this time, and she felt sure that he would seek
her at once, while she believed that his coming would
mean a great deal to her. There was an eager, expectant
look on her young face, a deeper flush in her
cheeks, a bright and hopeful light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander read the signs of the time well, and
realized that the hour for her to act had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warm weather was very enervating to her. She
drooped visibly, and calling her physician she asked
his advice regarding some change of residence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He advised her to leave the city immediately; to go
to some quiet country place where she could have pure
air, fresh, rich milk, and a nourishing diet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consequently she decided to seek a lovely place on
the Hudson, where she had spent a summer several
years previous, and where she could be as quiet as she
chose, and rest the livelong day if she wished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Knight decided to accompany her, for her
brother feared that the woman whom he still regarded
with far more than mere friendly feelings, was more
frail than she acknowledged herself to be, and he
thought she ought to have some one more experienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>than Virgie with her in the event of any more serious
illness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight himself was contemplating a trip
through the New England States, but promised to join
them and spend the remainder of the summer with
them upon his return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor Virgie was made very unhappy upon learning
of these plans, for it destroyed her hope of meeting
Rupert Hamilton, who, she believed, was even now
upon his way back to New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not, however, pose a single objection to
her mother’s plans, for the doctor had said her health
demanded an immediate change, and she was not selfish
enough to wish to delay a single hour, even though
her going might blight the fondest hopes of her
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she could not deceive the keen eyes of love, and
Mrs. Alexander was quick to note her paling cheek,
the thoughtful, wistful look upon her hitherto bright
face, and she realized with a bitter pang that already
her darling’s heart had responded to a stronger affection
than hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it made her all the more eager to hasten her
departure, and on the fifteenth of May they left New
York for their summer home upon the Hudson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it will be seen that Rupert, who arrived in
New York only a few days later, missed them, and was
cut off entirely from all communication with Virgie.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sought Mr. Knight upon the very day of his
arrival, but was greatly disappointed to learn that he
had left the city. He then repaired to the address
which he had given him, hoping to find Virgie, but the
house was closed; and though he inquired at one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>two places, no one could tell whither Mrs. Alexander
and her daughter had gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Life seemed to grow suddenly dark to him then, for
he had been looking forward to this hour with a great
deal of hope. It had been no light struggle for him
to break away from the party at San Jose as he had
done, and only a sense of honor and his own weakness
had enabled him to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that he loved Virgie Alexander with the
one strong passion of his life, and that if he had continued
the journey with her he must have told her
so. Mr. Knight’s conversation with him, however,
had convinced him that this would be wrong, and
so the only thing that remained for him was to get
out of the way of temptation. But during all his journey
he had looked forward to the day when, in her
mother’s presence, he could honorably proclaim his
affection, which only strengthened with every passing
day, and win her for his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>He remained in New York for two or three weeks,
hoping to learn something of either Mr. Knight or
the Alexanders; but he failed to do so, and then turned
his face in another direction, resolving to prolong his
stay in America until fall, with the hope of finding
Virgie, when he should again return to New York
before sailing for England.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spent the summer in visiting the New England
States, the great lakes, and some portions of Canada.
He saw much to interest him, but was conscious all
the time of one intense longing, one unsatisfied desire,
and it was with a feeling of relief that, at the
beginning of October, he found himself once more in
New York.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Sir William was very impatient for his return, and
had written charging him to take passage as early as
possible for home, for there was to be a great celebration
at Heathdale on the twentieth of the month to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of an
orphans’ home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consequently Rupert’s first duty was to engage
his stateroom for his return voyage, the steamer advertising
to sail on the eighth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he again instituted inquiries for his friends,
but none of them had yet returned, neither was he
able to discover their summer resort, and thus the
eighth of October came, and, with a sadder heart
than he ever possessed, Rupert went on board the
Cephalonia to return to his native land.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many times Sir William Heath had turned his
face homeward with just the same despair at his
heart; the same moody brow, and pained, anxious
face; the same intense longing for the woman whom
he loved better than life itself!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the end was not yet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Rupert stood at the stern of the vessel as the last
bell rang, and she slowly swung out from her moorings
and began to steam down the harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>His arms were tightly folded across his chest, which
seemed laden with a hundred-pound weight; his face
was pale and stern, his eyes moody and fixed upon
the receding domes and spires of the great city that
he had just left.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a conflict of emotions in his soul, and
rebellion was the fiercest of them all—rebellion against
his bitter disappointment and the unrequited love that
filled his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>He never moved from his post for an hour; he had
no interest in anything that was transpiring about
him; he knew, or thought he knew, no one on board,
and he had no desire for society just then, even if he
had; he cared little or nothing about the location of
his stateroom, or to learn who were to be his companions
during the next eight days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day was perfect. It had been oppressively
warm in the city, but there was a delightful breeze
upon the ocean and the air was delicious. There was
not a cloud to be seen, and the sun shone around that
floating world in matchless splendor, tipping every
wave and ripple made by the motion of the vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>with gleams of silver, while beyond the waters were
darkly and beautifully blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the young man was not conscious of any of this
beauty, and he might have stood there still another
hour, absorbed in his own sorrowful reflections, but
for a little circumstance that startled and shocked him
into new life.</p>

<p class='c007'>A voice near him was saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, do you think you would like to sit here?
this life-boat makes a nice shelter. I will arrange your
chair and wraps, and I am sure you will be comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks inviting,” was the pleasant rejoinder; “I
will at least try it until I begin to experience those
qualms which all voyagers so much dread.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A merry little laugh rang out at this—a laugh that
made Rupert Hamilton’s blood tingle and glow, and
his heart beat with quickened throbs; then the first
voice responded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are not going to have any qualms, mamma. I
am determined to be a good sailor, and I will not hear
a word about your being sick. Why, what should I do
for company without you, and not a friend to speak
to on this great ship?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert turned now to look at the speaker, his face
luminous with surprise and delight; the moody look
all gone from his brow, his fine lips wreathed with
smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this movement the young girl glanced up and
their eyes met.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Alexander!” cried the young man, going forward
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Mr. Hamilton!” Virgie stammered, her lovely face
suffused with blushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their hands met in an eager clasp, and Mrs. Alexander,
viewing this unexpected reunion of the youth
and maiden from her position a little in the background,
and noting how much their looks and actions
expressed, knew that she had run directly into the
danger she had been trying to escape all summer.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was too late to mend matters now; fate had
ordered it so to be, and she could only submit to the
inevitable with as good a grace as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma,” Virgie said, as soon as she could collect
herself, “this is Mr. Hamilton, whom we met during the
trip to California; Mr. Hamilton, let me introduce you
to my mother, Mrs. Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady and gentleman exchanged greetings, and
then Rupert insisted upon making himself useful to
Mrs. Alexander, who was still something of an invalid,
although much better than when we last saw her
in May.</p>

<p class='c007'>He unfolded her chair, saw her comfortably seated,
and then arranged her wraps and rugs so deftly, and
was so kindly attentive to her needs, so gentlemanly
and entertaining in conversation, that she was at once
disarmed of half her fears and prejudices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is really a very charming young man,” she admitted
to herself, as she lay back among her robes and
watched his expressive face while he talked with Virgie.
“I do not wonder that she became interested in
him, and, perhaps, after all, if she is to live in England,
it might be as well for her to make an English
alliance; I hope his family is a good one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That a great deal of mischief, if it could be regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>as such, had been done during those few weeks of
travel in the West was plainly apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert showed his happiness over this unexpected
meeting in every look and gesture. One could hardly
believe him to be the same person, who, half an hour
previous, had stood like some stern statue looking
back in despair upon the city he was leaving behind;
while as for Virgie, her mother scarcely knew
her for the drooping, pale-faced damsel that she had
been all summer, although she had not been guilty of
a single murmur.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander’s health had improved somewhat,
but she was far from strong even yet, and her physician
had urgently advised an ocean voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had demurred at first, but when he said, “Your
daughter, too, needs the change; I do not like her
looks at all,” her mother-love prevailed, and she
nerved herself for her long contemplated voyage to
England, feeling that perhaps the proper time had
come for her to act in the matter of Virgie’s inheritance,
and thus it chanced—if chance it was—that they
were booked for the same steamer in which Rupert
had sailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, alas! for Virgie’s boast that she was “determined
to be a good sailor,” for she had not been on
deck many hours before she was prostrated by that
much dreaded enemy of all voyagers, sea-sickness, and
thus all the pleasant <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</span></i> and promenades
which Rupert had begun to plan immediately upon
discovering that she was on board the steamer, came
to naught.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor girl was hardly able to lift her head from
her pillow during the whole voyage, and when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>arrived at Liverpool she was so reduced that she had
to be carried off the vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>She began to rally at once, however, after landing,
and continued to improve during the journey to London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander had borne it all wonderfully well,
suffering but very little from “qualms,” which she had
so much dreaded, and Rupert having constituted himself
her constant attendant, they had become the best
of friends during the eight days that they had spent
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they arrived in London, Rupert assisted them
in finding pleasant lodgings in an excellent locality,
and then began to think of his own friends at Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be in London again soon, and may I beg
the privilege of coming to see you occasionally?” he
asked, as he was taking leave of the two ladies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed, we shall be very glad to see you, Mr.
Hamilton,” Mrs. Alexander rejoined, cordially, while
Virgie blushed with pleasure at the request, and a shy
smile dimpled the corners of her pretty mouth. “But,”
she added, “you have not yet told us whither you are
going—in what portion of England is your home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no home really, as yet, Mrs. Alexander, but
I have friends in Hampshire County, and I am going
to them for a while,” Rupert replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>As was his custom, he seldom talked about himself,
and this was the first intimation that Mrs. Alexander
had received of his having friends in Hampshire, where
Sir William lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>She grew a trifle pale as he mentioned the fact, and
longed to ask him if he knew the baronet; but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>checked herself, and they separated without a suspicion
on her part of his being in any way connected
with the man whom she had come to England to
seek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight had given her letters of introduction to
some friends of his residing in Grosvenor square, and,
upon seeking them, she found them to be most delightful
people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Humphrey Huntington and his family occupied
a high social position in London, and thus had it in
their power to make it very pleasant for any one in
whom they were interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>They tried to persuade Mrs. Alexander to come to
them as their guest, instead of remaining in lodgings;
but she preferred, for various reasons, to be independent,
although she compromised the matter somewhat
by frequently allowing Virgie to visit Sir
Humphrey’s two daughters, who were about her own
age.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now there began a charmed life for Virgie
Alexander, as, for the present, we must continue to
call her, since her mother did not wish her to be introduced
by the name of Heath until she could be assured
that she would succeed in having her acknowledged
as the heiress of Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as she was sufficiently rested, Mrs. Alexander
intended to consult with some good lawyer and
give her interests into his care; but, meanwhile, she
was willing that her darling should enjoy to the utmost
the pleasures at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace and Helen Huntington were bright and attractive
girls, but neither of them possessed a tithe
of the beauty which the gods has conferred upon their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>young guest. They were generous and kind enough,
too, not to envy her for it, but rather made a pet of
her, and were proud to entertain the fair American,
who soon became an acknowledged belle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Huntingtons were in the habit of giving fortnightly
receptions to some of the <i><span lang="fr">bon ton</span></i>, of London,
and it was at one of these gatherings that Virgie made
her <i><span lang="fr">début</span></i> in society.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had never been much in company, having left
school only the previous year, but now she entered
into the enjoyment of everything with all the enthusiasm
of her girlish nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was very lovely on the evening of her first appearance
at a reception at Lady Huntington’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>She came into the great drawing-room leaning on
the arm of Helen Huntington, a sparkling brunette,
clad in garnet silk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie’s mother had taken great pains with her
toilet, and it was absolutely perfect. It was of finest
albatross cloth, combined with white satin, fitting her
slender form like a glove, and draped in the most
artistic manner, while the scarlet flowers, gleaming
here and there among the graceful folds, made a very
pleasing effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her nut-brown hair was loosely coiled and fastened
with a small silver comb, while a few light rings lay
in careless array upon her pure forehead. Her dark
eyes were gleaming with excitement and anticipation;
her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her red lips
wreathed with happy smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is that beautiful girl in white, with scarlet
verbenas?” asked a distinguished-looking woman, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>was conversing with Lady Huntington, as Virgie
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a young American for whom a friend of my
husband bespoke our hospitality and attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!” replied the other, looking interested, and
raising her glass for a better view of the stranger.
“I might have known. We have few beauties of that
delicate type in this country. What is her name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the woman started even as she asked the question,
while her glance searched Virgie’s face with an
eager, wondering look. Something in its delicate outlines
and striking beauty seemed to arouse long dormant
memories.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Alexander,” said Lady Huntington; “she and
her mother arrived from New York only ten days
ago. Would you like an introduction? She is very
charming, and wonderfully well informed for a girl
of her age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Um!—yes, presently; but——Sadie, do tell me
who she looks like!” and Mrs. Farnum, for it was she,
turned to a queenly woman near by, to draw her attention
to the fair stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sadie Farnum, or Lady Royalston, as she was now
known, had long since resigned all hope of becoming
the mistress of Heathdale, and, having married a
wealthy lord twice her age, had given herself up to
fashion and society.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of whom are you speaking, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of that girl who is standing beside Helen Huntington.
Of whom does she remind you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure I cannot tell,” Lady Royalston answered,
searching the bright face to which her attention
had been called. “It certainly has a familiar look,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and yet one that I cannot place. She is very pretty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Farnum did not reply, but continued to follow
every movement of that graceful form, every expression
of the sweet countenance, while she searched the
chambers of her memory for its counterpart and the
circumstances under which she had seen it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently the two girls approached Lady Huntington,
when she passed her arm around Virgie’s slight
waist, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, I wish to introduce you to an old friend
who has been inquiring about you. Mrs. Farnum,
allow me to present our young guest, Miss Virgie
Alexander.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>RUPERT’S REQUEST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Virgie Alexander!” repeated Mrs. Farnum to herself,
as she acknowledged the presentation, and it almost
seemed as if some one had struck a blow upon
her heart as she recalled that long-forgotten name
and looked into that delicate, clear-cut face, while a
vision from out of the past suddenly rose to confront
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She saw the tall, slight figure of a beautiful woman
very like this young girl, standing straight and proud
before her, as, with a face of agony and a voice full
of despair, she asserted her own purity and her child’s
legitimacy, and hurled back scorn for scorn upon the
arrogant women who repudiated her claim and tried
to crush her with a vile conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she seemed to hear those ringing, prophetic
words, “My child is also the lawful child of Sir William
Heath; she is the heiress of Heathdale, and she
shall yet occupy the position that rightfully belongs
to her. Let your ‘peer of the realm and his honored
family’ take warning; the time will come when a
righteous judgment will overtake them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shivered slightly as she recalled all this and Virgie
wondered what should make the fine-looking
woman grow so suddenly pale, and why she should
regard her with such a fixed and startled gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she gave the circumstance only a passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>thought, and then turned to speak to Lady Royalston,
to whom Lady Huntington also presented her, only to
find herself again the object of a curious and astonished
stare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sadie Farnum turned to her mother as the maiden
passed on, and the eyes of the two women, as they
met, expressed a great deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her name is Virgie, and she looks like that woman,”
whispered Mrs. Farnum, in an agitated voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She certainly does; but Lady Huntington introduced
her as Miss Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you understand? That was the name of her
father—that man who defaulted from the —— bank,
in San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True! I had forgotten. But—it cannot be possible
that this girl was that baby?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not? She is just about the age that child
would be. You know, it is eighteen years since we
were in America.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So it is. How time does fly!” Lady Royalston remarked,
with a sigh of regret for the lost hopes of her
youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, you know, that girl threatened to come to
England some time to claim her position.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Farnum had confided all the plot against Virgie
to her daughter after their return to England, and
upon learning that a divorce between Sir William
Heath and his wife had been secured, she had gathered
fresh hope that Sadie would yet become Lady
Heath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you said she did; but so many years have
elapsed without anything happening, I supposed she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>had given up that idea, particularly as she obtained a
divorce.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She was a high-spirited thing,” replied Mrs. Farnum,
with a troubled look, “and I believe she procured
a legal separation simply to show him that she would
not hold him bound if he wished to be free; but I
imagine that she has never relinquished the determination
to prove her child the heiress of Heathdale. I
am afraid Lady Linton’s plans will come to grief after
all, and if they do, we may become involved in the unpleasant
business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Royalston looked disturbed for a moment, then
she replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw! I would not worry over a fancied resemblance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not fancied,” returned her mother, “it is very
striking. You have seen it as well as I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the girl’s mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know. Lady Huntington simply said that
they arrived from New York ten days ago, bringing
a letter to Sir Humphrey from a friend who requested
his hospitality for them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is the case, they must have been moving in
good society,” remarked Lady Royalston, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and they must have means. Did you notice
the girl’s toilet? It was simply exquisite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; the finest of everything, and in the best of
taste. I cannot understand it, for you told me that Sir
William brought all his wife’s fortune back to England
with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She told me so herself! but she must have found
another somewhere, or they could not come here in
this style.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Perhaps she has married again,” suggested Lady
Royalston.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed. Don’t you understand? She still retains
her maiden name, with simply the ‘Mrs.’ added.
I must find out more about them. I will pump Lady
Huntington again before we leave,” Mrs. Farnum
concluded, rather inelegantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was as good as her word, but all that she could
learn was that Mrs. Alexander had come abroad for
her health—that she and her daughter were traveling
alone. Lady Huntington believed she was a widow,
but judged she must have lost her husband many
years ago, since she never mentioned him, and wore
no weeds. She said she was not able to go much into
society, being still something of an invalid, although
much better than before her voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was not very satisfactory to Mrs. Farnum,
and she felt very uneasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must see the woman for myself,” she told her
daughter. “I should know her at once, and I shall
not rest until I do. I sincerely wish we had never
meddled with that wretched business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish so, too,” sighed Lady Royalston, but it was
more for her mother’s sake than her own, for, as
we know, her sympathies had been with the poor
young wife when they were together in New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Virgie, all unconscious of the anxiety which
her presence had created, was enjoying herself exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She attracted a great deal of attention, and was soon
surrounded by a group of admirers who vied with each
other in doing homage to the lovely young American,
while the Misses Huntington appeared to enjoy her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>conquests as if they were themselves the recipients
of similar honors.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, in the midst of her triumphs, Virgie chanced
to glance toward the entrance to the drawing-room
and saw standing there a figure that sent all the blood
tingling to her finger-tips; and, as she met the eyes
that were fixed so admiringly upon her, her own sent
back a responsive glance which made Rupert Hamilton
forget that there was anyone else in the room and
start forward to greet her, regardless of the charmed
circle about her which he must pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Alexander!” he said, in a low, earnest tone,
“I did not anticipate this pleasure when I came hither
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you are a surprise to me,” Virgie answered,
blushing slightly. “I did not know that you were in
town. Have you been well since we parted?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very; and I do not need to ask if you fully recovered
from the effects of your voyage,” he returned,
with a glance that made her pulses leap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am, indeed, very well,” she said, “and mamma is
also very much improved, although she does not feel quite
equal to society yet. Did you find your friends well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thank you,” Rupert answered, but his face fell
at the question, for it brought Lillian so forcibly to
his mind. She had betrayed so much joy upon his return
that he had been painfully embarrassed and distressed
upon her account.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you been long in London?” Virgie asked,
wondering what caused the cloud upon his brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you ask that?” he returned, with a look that
made her own eyes droop. “I arrived this evening
with my guardian, and, finding cards for Lady Huntington’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>reception, dropped in to pay my regards to
the young ladies; but I could not be long in London
without availing myself of the privilege that I craved
when we parted. But,” glancing around and realizing
that their meeting was attracting more attention than
was agreeable, “will you let me take you out for an
ice? It is very warm here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie gladly availed herself of this invitation, for
his sudden coming had agitated her, and she did not
feel quite at her ease, while she, too, saw that her
meeting with Rupert had excited considerable surprise
in the group around her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man led her to a small reception-room,
found her a comfortable chair, and then remarked:
“Now, if you will excuse me for a moment, I will
get an ice for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please do not,” Virgie interrupted, laying her hand
lightly on his arm to detain him; “I do not care for it.
I was only glad of an excuse to get away from the
crowd for a few minutes’ quiet chat with you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped suddenly and colored with confusion at
her confession; but Rupert, with a radiant glow on his
face, drew a chair and sat down beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” he said; “and now tell me how have
you enjoyed London during the last ten days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid my enjoyment of London has been
rather doubtful,” Virgie returned, laughing, “since I
have seen scarcely anything of it for the fog and rain;
but I have met a good many people whom I consider
simply delightful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, judging from the court you were holding
when I came in to-night, those very people would return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the compliment most heartily,” said Rupert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did your guardian accompany you this evening?”
Virgie asked, by way of changing the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he was rather weary, and begged me to make
his excuses to Lady Huntington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have never told me who your guardian is, Mr.
Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t I? Then I have been very negligent, for he
is the best friend I have in the world. He is Sir
William Heath, and I hope to have an opportunity to
introduce you to him soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you intend to remain in London?” Virgie
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the present. Sir William Heath has a house
in town, and we shall all be here for several weeks.
By ‘all’ I mean Sir William’s sister, Lady Linton, her
daughter Lillian, who is a young lady a little older
than yourself, and—your humble servant,” explained
Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady Linton!” Virgie repeated, thoughtfully;
“where have I heard that name before? It is very
familiar, and yet I cannot recall the person to whom
it belongs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very likely you have heard it spoken in society
here, as Lady Linton is in the habit of going out a
good deal when in town,” returned the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps so,” Virgie assented, and yet almost positive
she had heard it before ever coming to London.</p>

<p class='c007'>They chatted a little longer, and then the young
girl said she must return to the company, and Rupert,
giving her his arm, conducted her back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>But once there, she was again surrounded by a
merry company, and he had no further opportunity
to converse with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, however, he called at Mrs. Alexander’s
lodgings, and was very cordially received by
that lady, whom he found looking far better than he
had ever seen her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was rapidly regaining flesh and strength, and
much of her old-time beauty as well. He had not
realized until now how very lovely she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie was not in when he arrived—she was out
driving with the Misses Huntington, her mother told
him—and, knowing that he could not long refrain
from speaking of his love for the beautiful girl, he
resolved that he would improve this opportunity and
crave Mrs. Alexander’s permission to address her
daughter with the hope of winning her for his
wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>But how to broach the subject so near his heart
was an embarrassing question, and after the first few
moments he became thoughtful, and even pale, causing
Mrs. Alexander to wonder if anything had gone
wrong with him since his return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid your native air does not agree with
you, Mr. Hamilton,” said his hostess, breaking an
awkward pause; “you are not looking as well as when
I saw you last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The truant color rushed into the young man’s face
in a torrent at this remark, and he made a bold venture,
resolved to put his fate to the test at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not my ‘native air,’ Mrs. Alexander,” he answered,
smiling slightly; “but, finding you alone this
morning, I have been impelled to confess something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to you, and yet I find myself lacking the courage to
break the ice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely, I did not suppose that I was one to inspire
fear in anyone,” remarked his friend, archly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not; but when one’s dearest hopes are at
stake, it is sometimes hard to speak of them,” Rupert
answered, gravely; then added, frankly: “Mrs. Alexander,
you must have suspected ere this how fondly
I love your daughter. I have loved her ever since our
meeting on that California trip last winter, and I have
only been waiting for your sanction to my suit to open
my heart to her. I hoped to see you last spring on my
return to New York, but you had left the city and I
could not learn your address. I then resolved to seek
you again at the end of the summer, but you were
still absent when I came back the last of September.
You can, perhaps, imagine something of my disappointment—I
may even say despair——when I found
that I must return to England with no hope of confessing
my love to Virgie. I do not need to tell you
that I experienced a sudden ecstasy when I discovered
that you were both on the same vessel with me and
bound for the same port, and I could not have remained
silent as long as I have, had it not been for the
illness which kept my dear one a prisoner in her
berth during our voyage. I know that I am, comparatively,
a stranger to you, but you are so situated now
that you can easily ascertain whether what I have to
offer Virgie—a true heart, an untarnished name, and
all that I have of this world’s goods—is worthy of
her acceptance. Mrs. Alexander, will you give me
leave to try to win her?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 id='XIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE BETROTHAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Alexander smiled at the young lover’s ardor,
while she regarded his handsome, earnest face with a
look almost of affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Hamilton,” she said, as he concluded, “to be
frank with you, I must tell you that I have been expecting
a request of this nature from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert looked a trifle surprised at this declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mother’s eyes are very sharp,” the lady resumed,
“and it has not required much penetration to see that
you were learning to regard my Virgie with more
than friendly affection; besides, Mr. Knight told me
of the conversation that he had with you at San Jose,
and warned me of what I might expect when you returned
to New York. And now I will confess to you
freely that I was very much opposed to the idea of having
Virgie become the wife of an Englishman. I had
reason for the prejudice, which I will explain to you
some other time; and I resolved you two should not
meet again if I could help it. I did help it, as you
know; that was the reason why I left New York so
early; but only to be overreached by fate, which decreed
that we should all come aboard at the same time.
The moment Virgie introduced you to me, on board
the Cephalonia, I felt that I was powerless, and so resigned
myself to the inevitable. I must admit, however,”
Mrs. Alexander added, with a genial smile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“that I was disarmed of my prejudices before I had
known you many hours, and as I became better acquainted
with you, I could but acknowledge with Mr.
Knight, who, by the way, is a strong champion in your
favor, that I should be proud to give my daughter
to so true a man; and so, Mr. Hamilton, you have my
full and free permission to win my darling if you can,
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you!” Rupert cried, seizing his companion’s
hand in his gratitude, his face luminous with
joy; “you have made me the happiest man in London.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like to see young people happy,” Mrs. Alexander
replied, still smiling, but with a little sigh; “and I
imagine it is safe to tell you I think you have no cause
for fear. But now tell me something about yourself
and your family; I should not like to make inquiries
about you of other people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is not very much to tell,” Rupert said. “I
am an orphan; my mother died when I was an infant;
my father was a major in her majesty’s service, and
the only relatives I have living are an uncle and his
family, by the name of Shaftonsbury, so my home has
been with my guardian in Hampshire County——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Hampshire! Who is your guardian?” hastily
asked Mrs. Alexander, paling a little at the familiar
name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was my father’s dearest friend, Sir——” began
Rupert, but before he could speak the name the door
opened, and Virgie, looking flushed and beautiful from
her exercise in the open air, stood upon the threshold,
and the young man, forgetting both question and answer,
sprang forward to greet her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The conversation became general then for a little
while; but by and by Mrs. Alexander excused herself,
saying she had letters to write, and left the young
couple alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert’s eyes had been seeing a great deal ever
since Virgie came in; so much that she could not meet
them without her color coming and going with tell-tale
consciousness; and when, the moment the door
closed after her mother, he arose and came to her side,
she knew instinctively what was trembling on his
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling,” he said, in a low, earnest tone, “I
have just told your mother that I love you, and she has
given me leave to win you if I can. Virgie, I have
loved you ever since those delightful days that we
spent together on the way to California. I might have
told you of it even then, had not Mr. Knight and my
own sense of what was right warned me against it.
But now, dearest, there are no barriers, unless you
yourself raise one between us, and my heart bids me
hope that you will not. Tell me, dear, that you love
me—that you will be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He knelt by her side and gathered the two small
hands that lay upon her lap into his, while he searched
the lovely downcast face with his eager eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not repulse him; she made no effort even to
release her hands from his clasp. She cast one shy,
sweet glance into his face, a little smile of love and joy
trembled on her lips, while rosy blushes surged up to
the waves of bright hair lying on her forehead, and
Rupert needed no other answer to assure him of his
heart’s desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do love me, my darling!” he cried, drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>her into his arms. “I read it in your dear face, in
your beautiful eyes; but let me hear it from your lips.
I am selfish enough not to be satisfied with anything
less. Virgie, you will give yourself to me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she whispered, her head drooping until her
hair almost mingled with his; “you <em>made</em> me love you
on that journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if I had known it then I fear I could not have
held my peace,” he interrupted, laying his lips fondly
against her forehead. “I had, in fact, to run away
from you at San Jose lest I should violate all bonds
and betray myself in spite of the caution of Mr.
Knight, who said I must wait until you were safely
back with your mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did Mr. Knight suspect?” faltered Virgie, growing
crimson again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed he did. He is a very observing old gentleman,
and took me to task for monopolizing you so
much. He was right, too, dear, for it would have been
rash and imprudent for me to have tried to win you
then, and I honored him for restraining me, though
it required a terrible wrench for me to tear myself
away from you; but I knew my only safety was in
flight. I resolved, however, that I would settle the
question when I returned to New York; but I was
very miserable when I came back in May and could
not find you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I, too, Rupert,” Virgie confessed. “I thought
it is very hard when the doctor ordered mamma away
just at the very time when I was looking for you; but
of course I could not say a word, for her health was
of more importance than anything else, while——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“While what, Virgie?” her lover asked, as she
stopped in confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While I was not sure but that I was nourishing a
delusion; and, taking it all in all, I was very
wretched.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! and you have been loving me all this time?”
Rupert breathed, as he bent to kiss the lips that had
confessed so much. “And I have been fearing that
you might send me away hopeless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not send you away, Rupert.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Virgie, I hope I shall not wake to find this all
a dream,” he breathed, as he folded her closer in his
arms, and drew her head upon his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not fear,” the young girl returned, looking
archly up into his eyes. “I assure you I have ample
evidence that you are very much awake now, and, if
you please, it won’t do to disarrange my hair <em>too</em>
much, for Grace Huntington is coming back in an
hour to help me plan for Lady Dunforth’s ball that is
to occur next week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert laughed, but released her, smoothing very
tenderly the tresses that he had disarranged; then
seating himself on the sofa beside her, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How will it be, my Virgie—can you be content to
remain in England, or are you such a stanch American
that you will pine for your native land?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is said that ‘home is where the heart is,’ and if
<em>you</em> are to live in England, I am afraid that America
would not seem very home-like to me, even though
it was my birthplace,” Virgie confessed, with a shy
smile that was very bewildering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you will not mind becoming an English matron?”
Rupert observed, with a caress that again endangered
the glossy tresses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Yes, I think I shall mind it very much,” Virgie
retorted; “so much that I should be unhappy to be
anything else. Besides,” she added, more gravely,
“my father was an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it possible? But I do not think that Alexander
is an English name,” Rupert returned. “Of what portion
of England was he a native?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know, Rupert,” Virgie said, looking troubled.
“I imagine there is something about my father
that mamma has never been willing to tell me. She
always grows so sad and pale whenever I speak of
him that I have not the heart to question her, although,
as I have grown older, I have been very desirous of
knowing more concerning him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you remember him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; I never saw him. He was called home to
England a few weeks before my birth, and was lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost at sea! How sad! Mrs. Alexander must have
been very young.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, she was only a little over twenty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will probably visit your father’s home now
that you are here,” Rupert remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I asked mamma that one day, and she grew so
white that I was frightened. She remarked that that
was one object she had in coming abroad, but it was
chiefly for my sake; and then she shivered as if there
was something about it that she regarded with great
dread. But hush! she is coming back to us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander entered at that moment, and smiled
as she saw the happy faces of the two young lovers,
although Virgie was sure that there was a suspicious
redness about her eyes, as if she had been weeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have won her, Mrs. Alexander,” Rupert said,
taking Virgie by the hand and leading her to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>mother. “This dear girl has promised to be my wife,
and I am sure you will give us your blessing and
congratulations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed I will,” she responded, heartily, though she
appeared greatly agitated as she drew Virgie into her
arms and tenderly kissed her blushing cheek; “and I
give her to you very willingly, because I feel sure that
you are worthy of her, and I am confident that you
will make each other happy. Still,” she added, a little
sadness in her voice, “it is not an easy thing for a
mother to give away her only child, or to feel that she
has been supplanted in her affections.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not supplanted, mamma—do not say that!” cried
Virgie, clinging to her; “it could not be! I could never
love you less, even though I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even though you love Rupert more,” interposed
her mother, archly. “I expect that, of course, and
would not have it otherwise. I wish you to be all
in all to each other, and,” her voice growing husky
with emotion, “may no cloud ever dim your happiness;
may nothing ever come between you to mar your
confidence in each other. Oh, my darling!” she cried,
in a voice of agony, as she folded the lovely girl almost
convulsively to her heart, and seeming to forget for
the moment where she was, “I would rather lay you
away in your grave to-day than to have you live to
suffer what I have suffered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma,” cried Virgie, looking up anxiously into
the almost convulsed face bending over her, “what
can you mean? I have never seen you so unnerved before.
Surely if you are in trouble, you should not
hide it from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgive me, love, for casting a shadow upon your
joy at this time,” said her mother, recovering herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>with an effort; “but your happiness brought back all
my own early hopes—hopes that were most cruelly
blighted—so vividly that I forgot myself. Do not
mind me, Virgie; your future looks very bright, and
I have done wrong even to allude to anything to distress
you on this day of all others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie stood back and looked gravely into her mother’s
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma,” she said, with a seriousness that was
new to her, “I fear that you have been hiding something
from me all my life. I have often suspected it,
and your excessive agitation this morning proves it.
If you have known any great trouble in the past; if, as
I surmise, it is connected with my father, I feel that
you ought to confide it to me, and let me at least sympathize
with, if I cannot alleviate, your sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander grew very thoughtful at these words.
For a moment she stood irresolute, then a look of resolve
overspread her face, and she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down, my children, and listen to me. I believe
the time has come when I should open my heart to you,
my Virgie, and since Rupert is now one of us it will be
just as well for him to hear the story that I have to
tell you at the same time; it will save a repetition, and
I am not strong enough to review the past many
times. Perhaps, too,” she added, turning to the young
man, who, in obedience to her request, had drawn his
betrothed back to her seat upon the sofa, “you may
be able to give me some advice regarding a duty which
I have soon to perform.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat down near the lovers as she ceased speaking,
but looking more like a statue of wax than a living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>being, for it seemed almost like going to her own
execution to confess the wrongs which had been the
death-blow to all the hopes of her own youth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='XV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>“I HAVE MET LADY LINTON BEFORE.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You have always supposed, Virgie,” Mrs. Alexander
continued, after pausing a moment to summon
all her fortitude for the duty which lay before her,
“that your father was dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And is he not, mamma?” cried the startled girl,
growing almost as pale as her mother, and casting
a terrified look upon her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, dear; he is still living and here in England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma!” and the cry of dismay, almost of agony,
smote heavily on the fond mother’s heart, while Rupert
Hamilton gazed from one to the other, a look of
wonder on his fine face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be quiet, Virgie,” returned Mrs. Alexander, gently.
“No stigma rests upon either your name or mine, as I
perceive you apprehend. Although I was most cruelly
deserted in less than a year after my marriage, and at
a time when I needed tenderest care and sympathy;
although I was scorned and repudiated by the family
of the man whom I had wedded; although I was left
weak, unprotected, and comparatively destitute in a
strange city—yet I have risen above it all; I have been
able to prove that I was a lawful wife; that my child
could claim an honored name, and it is for that purpose
that I am here in London to-day. But let me
begin at the beginning, and tell you all about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She went back to the commencement of her acquaintance
with Sir William, although she did not call him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>name—she was not quite ready to reveal that yet—and
related all the story of his visit to that settlement
among the mountains of Nevada. She told how
he had won her; how kind he had been to her invalid
father, and how they had been married while he was
so ill; how, after his death, her husband had taken her
to many places of interest in order to win her mind
from her grief, and had made himself so necessary and
was so devoted to her that she had grown to idolize
him and to believe him the truest and noblest man on
earth. She told of his sudden recall to England, while
she was obliged to remain behind; of the sudden cessation
of letters; of the arrival at the hotel, where she
was boarding, of two English ladies, whom she did
not name, who were the means finally of her discovering
her husband’s faithlessness, his previous engagement
to one of his own countrywomen, and his subsequent
marriage with her, in defiance of those bonds
that he had assumed in connection with her. She related
how she had at once returned to the West, where
she had collected incontestable proofs of her marriage,
notwithstanding that she had no certificate; how she
had been enabled to turn her artistic talents to account
and provide for her own necessities. She spoke
of the divorce that she had obtained, and her reasons
for wishing to secure it, scorning to remain bound to
a man who had deserted her, and yet desirous of saving
another pure woman from dishonor. Then she
told something of her father’s history and fortunes,
of her uncle’s return, his repentance and restitution,
and the provision which he had made for her and
which had placed her forever beyond the fear of want
or the need of toil, even though she might never recover
the fortune that her father had left her, or succeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>in establishing Virgie’s claim to her inheritance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a sad, heart-breaking story, and told with
thrilling power and earnestness by the long-tried
woman, who almost seemed to be enduring again the
sufferings of her early life; and when at length it was
concluded, she was nearly exhausted by the effort it
had cost her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie had long since crept to her mother’s side, and
was now in tears, with her arms twined about her and
her head resting on her bosom; while Rupert sat near
with averted eyes and looking grave and deeply distressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mamma, why have you not told me this before?”
Virgie at length asked, trying to control her
sobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because, my darling, I could not bear to sadden
your young life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I could have sympathized with you, and then
I need not have pained you by asking so many distressing
questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was better for me to bear my burden alone,”
her mother persisted; “of course I know it would have
to be told some time, but I have put it off as long as
I could. Now, however, I must soon confront the man
who has so wronged us, and demand justice and restitution
for you, and so it has become necessary that
you should know all this sad history.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, mamma, if he was married to that other woman
there may be other children, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie could not go on, but broke down in distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True; there are—at least I know of one; but that
fact cannot affect your claim or deter me from demanding
that you be recognized as the legitimate heir; for,
of course, unless he made his second marriage legal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>after the divorce was obtained, you alone have any
lawful claim upon him,” returned Mrs. Alexander, in
a resolute tone, and with a look that denoted an inflexible
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that will be dreadful,” Virgie said, greatly
troubled; “just think of the shame that such a proceeding
would bring upon those who are innocent of
wrong; they are not to blame for the evil that my—that
their father has done, and it does not seem right
that they should be made to suffer, or be deprived
of their inheritance; think of their poor mother and
all her hopes for her children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does it count for nothing, Virgie, that my hopes
were crushed; that I was abandoned when you were
a helpless little one; that I was left to depend upon
myself and to provide for you?” cried her mother,
sternly; though there was a note of keenest agony in
her tones. “Does it count for nothing that the happiness
of my whole life has been wrecked; that I was
repudiated, scorned, mocked; that you have never
been acknowledged by your own name, never allowed
to occupy your true position in life?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it has all been wrong, cruel, wicked,” Virgie
returned, sadly and with trembling lips; “but I
have been very happy, with you, mamma; you have
never allowed me to realize anything of this trouble;
we have had everything we needed, and your fortune
is ample without striving for that which you affirm
should be mine; I cannot bear to think that anyone
must be made to suffer just to secure a little more
wealth, or a higher position in life, for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And are you willing to sacrifice all your rights to
those who have supplanted you—who have lived all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>their lives upon your heritage?” demanded Mrs. Alexander,
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma,” Virgie answered, sitting up and meeting
her mother’s flashing eye with a proud look, “leaving
the innocent out of the question entirely, I scorn to
accept anything from the man who has so wronged
you; I would not be recognized as his child; I would
not be known by his name, were he allied to royalty
itself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander leaned forward and kissed the beautiful
girl, clasping her fondly to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, my darling, you are not lacking in spirit, in
spite of your forgiving nature,” she said; “but justice
demands that he shall make you restitution; that must
be part of his punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then turning to Rupert she continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a man, just and true, Mr. Hamilton; you
have heard my story as a disinterested witness, and are
therefore capable of judging with an unprejudiced
mind; I ask you, is it right that I should demand for
my child the position and inheritance that belong to
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Rupert Hamilton replied, gravely, decidedly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is right; a great wrong has been done both you
and Virgie, and it is but just that it should be atoned
for as far as may be—if not willingly, then by compulsion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man little realized that he was passing
sentence upon his respected and well-beloved guardian;
but he had been greatly shocked by the story to
which he had listened, and he deemed no punishment
too severe for him who had been guilty of such
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie sighed at his verdict. She never could bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the thought of giving pain to others, and she shrank
almost with loathing from meeting one who had caused
her mother so much unhappiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, who is my father?” she asked, after a
thoughtful pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, I do not wish to tell you just yet, for you
are liable to meet him or some members of his family
in society, and you will be happier not to know it, at
least until my plans are matured and I have decided
when and how to act. I have simply related this story
to you now because I thought that Rupert ought to
know something of our history, and to prepare you
for what must soon occur.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; I will wait your time,” the young girl
returned; but a little shiver of dread crept over her;
she felt that she could never forgive or own the man
who had so ill-treated her beautiful mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And one thing more,” continued Mrs. Alexander,
turning to Rupert. “I should prefer that your engagement
remain unannounced for a little while, until
this business is settled. My lawyer hopes to be able
to arrange matters in the course of two or three
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It shall be just as you wish,” the young man responded,
adding, with a fond smile, as he turned to
Virgie: “So long as I am assured of the love that I
crave it matters little to me whether the world knows
it or not for the present. I would, however, like to
make one exception. I should like to inform my guardian
of the fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is but right,” returned Mrs. Alexander; and
she was again about to ask the name of his guardian,
but a ring of their bell just then warned them that
Miss Huntington had arrived, and as she entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Rupert took his leave, wondering to himself who this
man was, who evidently stood so high in London society,
and who had so ruthlessly ruined the life of a
beautiful and trusting woman and discarded his own
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few evenings after this Virgie, accompanied by
her mother for the first time, attended the reception
and ball given by Lord and Lady Dunforth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Dunforth had herself been a beautiful American
girl—Brownie Douglas by name—and she was
always eager to entertain her countrywomen when
they visited London.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had met Virgie at the Huntingtons, and had at
once been attracted toward her, and had taken pains to
secure her presence on her next evening at home, arranging
for extra attractions for her sake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander was feeling unusually well on this
night, and had taken a great deal of pains with her
own and her daughter’s toilet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie’s costume was exquisite, consisting of pale blue
satin, with an overdress of misty lace, wrought
with tiny crystals, and draped with clusters of blush-roses,
while she wore strings of rare pearls on her
neck and arms and in her hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander wore simple black, but of richest
material and finest texture, while her laces were exceptionally
rare and her diamonds of the purest water.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a strikingly beautiful woman. Her form
was finely developed, and yet it had lost nothing of
the graceful outline of her maidenhood. Her face possessed
a peculiar delicacy of beauty, and her complexion
was as faultless as of old. She had gained much
in ease and self-possession; her bearing was regal, her
manner charming.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Lady Dunforth was even more delighted with her
than she had been with Virgie, and took especial pains
to present her to her most honored guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened that Lady Linton and Lillian were also
present that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both were accomplished society women, and were
much sought after, because of their tact and brilliancy,
for there was never any lack of life, there was
never any stiffness or awkwardness where they were.
Lady Linton could entertain charmingly, and Lillian
was always the center of a brilliant circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>But for once Lady Linton’s accomplishment in this
direction failed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Lady Dunforth was presenting Mrs. Alexander
to some of her guests, she suddenly came face to face
with Sir William Heath’s sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Lady Linton,” said her hostess, in her genial
way, “I have a friend here to whom I would like to
introduce you; Mrs. Alexander—Lady Linton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her ladyship gave one glance into the beautiful face
before her, and recognized it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew her instantly for the woman who had
saved her life at the time of that frightful railroad disaster
eight years previously; who had nursed her so
faithfully during the illness that followed, and who
had afterward told her, “I am the woman whom your
brother loved—whom he wooed and won.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A deadly pallor overspread her countenance, while
her customary elegant self-possession was utterly
routed. She was actually stricken dumb—her lips refused
to pronounce the name she had heard, in acknowledgment
of the introduction; she could only
stand still with her eyes fastened in a blank, startled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>stare upon that graceful figure, while her heart sank
a dead weight in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instinctively Lady Linton knew why Mrs. Alexander
was there in London. She had come to fulfill the
threat that she had uttered so long ago, and a terrible
despair settled down upon the finished woman of the
world, rendering her speechless, constrained, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander, however, was entirely at her ease.
She had expected to meet this woman in society at
some time or other, and was prepared for the encounter.</p>

<p class='c007'>She bowed with exceeding grace, but with a suspicion
of ironical politeness, while she remarked in
cool, placid tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had the pleasure of meeting Lady Linton before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sound of her voice broke the spell that held
her ladyship enthralled; she managed to bow and to
murmur some inarticulate words in return, then Lady
Dunforth passed on with her guest, wondering if Lady
Linton was ill, that she should appear so unlike herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h2 id='XVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>MORE INTRODUCTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile another spiritual episode was transpiring
in a different portion of Lady Dunforth’s drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian Linton, brilliantly beautiful in pale pink silk,
with elegant ornaments of opals, was entertaining a
group of young people, while merry jest and sparkling
repartee ran from lip to lip, when, chancing to glance
toward the door, she saw Rupert Hamilton coming forward
with a girl of bewildering loveliness leaning on
his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart gave a great startled bound as she looked,
for something in the glance, at once proud and fond,
which the young man bent upon his fair companion—something
in the happy, trustful eyes which Virgie
raised to meet her lover’s, told her that her own
dream of love in connection with her uncle’s ward
could never be realized.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert had appeared very different to her since his
return from America. While he always treated her
with every mark of politeness and friendliness, there
was at the same time an unusual reserve—a constraint
in his manner which seemed like a brazen wall between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first she had told herself that it was because he
had been absent so long; that when he was once
more thoroughly settled at home matters would resume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>their usual course, and she would be able to win him
by the witchery of her charms.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had been restless and absent-minded; he was
anxious to get back to London, and could hardly control
his impatience until the family completed their
arrangements to go for a while to their town house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now she could understand it all. She was quick
and keen enough to comprehend why his handsome
face was all aglow; why his eyes beamed with that
tender, unaccustomed light that called the soft color to
the young girl’s cheeks and wreathed her red lips with
happy smiles—he loved and was beloved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her proud, passionate heart instantly arose in rebellion
against the cruel fate which decreed that the
sweetest hopes of her life must be blighted; that the
love of which she had dreamed all her life, and which
had grown into her soul so strong and deep, must be
denied her, just as she had begun to feel so sure of
winning it.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the girl was peerlessly beautiful, and of a more
delicate and refined type than herself, she realized
with a pang of jealousy, and she was conscious, too,
that Rupert was bringing her straight toward her,
doubtless with the intention of introducing her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike her mother, she had a moment in which to
compose and brace herself before meeting her rival;
and, calling all her pride to her aid, she looked the
picture of brilliant, happy maidenhood when Rupert
reached her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lillian,” he said, “I wish to introduce you to a
friend; Miss Alexander—Miss Linton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian put forth her daintily gloved hand without
a tremor, and, with a dazzling smile, expressed her
pleasure at making her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Miss Alexander is an American,” Rupert explained,
and Lillian’s heart sank; a sudden faintness seemed
to come over her at his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her brother Percy’s prophecy had been verified; he
had fallen in love with this girl while on his tour in
the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she would rather have died than betrayed anything
of her dismay before the girl, and looking
straight into Virgie’s clear eyes, she said, brightly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! then I suppose you have recently come abroad,
as I have not met you before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we were passengers on the same steamer with
Mr. Hamilton,” Virgie answered, “and we owe him a
great deal, for he was very kind to us—mamma and
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how do you like England and English people?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very much,” Virgie replied, smiling, while her
eyes turned instinctively to Rupert, as if she judged
the whole nation by her estimate of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian shut her white teeth together viciously as she
saw the look and Rupert’s answering smile, and she
wondered what her mother would say when she
learned that her uncle’s ward had bestowed his heart
upon a hated American.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever been in the United States, Miss
Linton?” Virgie asked, wholly unconscious of the disturbance
which her presence was creating.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I traveled considerably there one summer several
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And were you pleased with my country?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, of course America is very different from
England, and I like my own land best, although America
has some grand scenery,” Lillian responded. “But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>mamma came near losing her life there in a terrible
railway accident, and I was only too glad to get safely
home again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” said Virgie, with a quick indrawn breath, “I
remember; we were on that very train. Is that Lady
Linton your mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; how strange that you should have been in
that accident, too?” returned Lillian, greatly surprised.
“Were you injured?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; mamma and I both escaped unhurt, though my
maid had one arm badly broken. I can just remember
Lady Linton; mamma took me to see her just before
we left the place; I was sure I had heard the name before,
when Mr. Hamilton mentioned her to me one
day last week, but I could not place it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder——” began Lillian, excitedly, and then
she suddenly checked herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was just upon the point of saying, “I wonder if
your mother was the lady who was so kind to mamma
while she was so ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton had been obliged to confirm her physician’s
statements to her son when he arrived, that a
brave woman had saved her life at the time of the
accident, and then carefully and faithfully nursed her
through a critical crisis afterward; but she pretended
not to know her name and never mentioned her again,
though Percy and his sister often spoke of the circumstance
with considerable curiosity and interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie raised questioning eyes, as Lillian cut herself
short, and she felt compelled to complete her sentence
in some way, so she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder there were not more lives lost at that
time; it must have been a shocking accident. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>have you seen Lady Dunforth’s Japanese curiosities,
Miss Alexander?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I have not,” Virgie answered, thinking her new
acquaintance had changed the subject rather abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then let me take you to examine them, Vir—Miss
Alexander,” Rupert interposed, eagerly, glad of
an excuse to get her again to himself, and Virgie,
bowing a graceful adieu to Lillian, took his arm and
allowed him to lead her from the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian watched them with an angry, aching heart,
but she was obliged to conceal her feelings, for she
knew that others were observing her, and not for the
world would she have her jealous fears suspected; so
it was not long before she was again the life and center
of an admiring circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert led Virgie to a small room opposite the
drawing-room, which had been fitted up in Japanese
style, and where many curiosities and choice bric-a-brac
from that country had been collected and tastefully
arranged.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a lovely room, and Virgie was delighted with
its unique treasures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lovers spent some time examining the different
objects and in the enjoyment of each other’s society,
and they had nearly made the round of the room
when someone put aside the curtains of the door-way
and entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert glanced up, and then started forward, his
face lighting with a smile of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Will,” he cried, “I did not know that you
were coming here to-night. When did you arrive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only a few moments ago,” returned Sir William
Heath, regarding his ward affectionately. “I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>expect that I should be able to accept Lady Dunforth’s
invitation; in fact, I told Miriam I could not, but I
managed to get through my business somewhat earlier
than usual, and so concluded to drop in here for a
little relaxation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad you did; you are working too hard,
Uncle Will, and need more recreation. But come, I
have a friend here whom I want you to know,” Rupert
concluded, linking his arm within his guardian’s and
leading him toward Virgie, who was examining an
elaborate piece of embroidery on the opposite side of
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! a young lady!” remarked Sir William, archly,
as his glance fell upon the pretty figure; her face he
could not see, for it was turned from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert colored slightly at his tone, but he said nothing
until he reached the side of his betrothed, then he
remarked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Alexander, I want to introduce you to the best
friend I have in the world, my guardian, Sir William
Heath.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie turned, a smile of pleasure on her lips, for she
had longed to meet Rupert’s guardian, and something
in the fair face which she lifted to him, in that delicate
profile, in those refined features, in the glancing
of her eye, and in the very movement she made, as
she stepped forward to greet him, suddenly smote the
baronet with the strangest sensation that he ever experienced,
yet he never dreamed that he was looking
into the face of his own daughter!</p>

<p class='c007'>It almost seemed to him as if he had known her
before in some previous state of existence—as if somewhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>in the dim and misty past their souls had met
and held sweet and genial converse.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment he hardly knew whether he was in the
body or out; a mist obscured his sight, a mighty ringing
was in his ears, dulling every other sound, while
the very earth seemed quaking beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Will, you are ill!” was the startled remark
that recalled him to himself, and made him suddenly
realize that he was conducting himself very strangely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my boy, it is only a sudden dizziness; it will
pass in a moment; it is gone even now, and I beg
pardon for alarming you and your friend,” the baronet
replied, as his vision began to clear and he met the
beautiful dark eyes of the young girl fixed upon him
with a look of deep concern.</p>

<p class='c007'>He put out a hand to steady himself, even as he
spoke, and she took a step forward, drawn toward
him by a power of attraction she could not understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pray sit down, Sir William; have this rocker,” she
said, as she drew forward a light but roomy willow
chair for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” he returned; “let us all sit; we can chat
a few moments more comfortably so,” and he gladly
sank into the rocker, still feeling as if the floor was
slipping from under him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert drew another chair for Virgie, and then went
to get a glass of water for his guardian, for his pallor
alarmed him greatly.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was soon entirely himself again, making light
of his sudden attack, and they sat and talked some
time about the curiosities around them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the baronet watched every movement of the fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>young stranger with an eager, wistful eye. Her grace
charmed him more and more; even the tones of her
voice thrilled him with a painfully sweet sensation,
and whenever she addressed him the tears would
almost start into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you a stranger in London?” he asked, after a
little pause in their conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; but I have not been allowed to remember
the fact since coming here—everyone is so kind,” she
said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is your home?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In New York city, on the other side of the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed! Then you have come hither recently?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is scarcely three weeks since my arrival in London,”
Virgie returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William turned a questioning look upon Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I met Miss Alexander during my trip, Uncle Will,”
he said, quietly, but coloring beneath his glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alexander!” repeated the baronet, with a sudden
start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not quite catch the name before. Is New
York your parents’ native place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir. Mamma’s early home was in the West,
and my father—oh! what have I done?”</p>

<p class='c007'>In her nervousness, caused by speaking of her father,
Virgie had swept something from the table, by which
she was sitting, with a motion of her arm, and it had
fallen with a crash to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No harm,” Rupert returned, as he stooped to pick
it up, “it is only a metallic paper knife and could not
break. It is, however, a curiously carved affair; had
you noticed it?” and he passed it to her to examine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>for he observed that she was disturbed and excited by
the mention of her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie took it, glad of an excuse for changing the
subject, and then they all fell to discussing the skill
and ingenuity of the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they sat thus, a face suddenly looked in upon
them from the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the face of Lady Linton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had heard voices there, while passing, and
stepped to the door-way, impelled by an unusual
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took in the situation instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her brother had told her that he could not attend
Lady Dunforth’s reception that evening, and, ever
since her encounter with Mrs. Alexander, she had been
congratulating herself that he had been detained, while
now she had found him here, sitting face to face with
his own daughter, and perhaps upon the very verge
of discovering her relationship to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could have shrieked aloud with terror and
anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Must all her skillfully wrought plans come to
naught?</p>

<p class='c007'>Had she sacrificed truth and honor for years, to fail
now—to have the woman whom she had hated all her
life triumph over her at last?</p>

<p class='c007'>No! She would fight it out to the bitter end; if there
was any power on earth that could keep them apart
they should never meet, and she must begin now—this
instant, by breaking up this interesting group.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William!” she cried, in a strangely altered voice,
“<em>you here!</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William started up at the words, turned and saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>his sister standing upon the threshold with a face of
ghastly whiteness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. What is the matter, Miriam?” and he sprang
forward and caught her in his arms, just as she was
falling to the floor in a well-feigned swoon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 id='XVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='large'>SOME STARTLING DISCOVERIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of course the attention of all centered at once upon
Lady Linton, and Sir William’s interest in his beautiful
but unknown daughter was, for the time, merged
in his anxiety for his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it happened, there was no one else in the room
just then, and Rupert and his guardian laid the
apparently unconscious woman upon a lounge that was
standing near, and immediately exerted themselves for
her recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie, too, was very helpful, dipping her own
dainty handkerchief into some water that Rupert
brought, and bathing Lady Linton’s face with it, while
she gave directions to Sir William about chafing her
hands to assist in restoring circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the woman began to show signs of recovery
and opened her eyes, she found herself looking directly
into the face of the lovely girl whose presence there
had caused her so much concern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is my brother?” she demanded, jerking her
head away from the gentle hand that was ministering
so tenderly to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am here, Miriam,” said Sir William, bending over
her. “What shall I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take me home,” she replied, with a shiver, as she
glanced darkly at Virgie, who had drawn back and
was standing beside Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“I will, as soon as you are able,” her brother replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am able now,” and she sat up with surprising
energy for one who but a few moments before had
appeared so seriously ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; I will attend you immediately,” Sir
William responded; “but,” he added, as he regarded
her anxiously, “what could have caused this sudden
attack? I never knew you to faint before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A guilty stain shot for a moment into Lady Linton’s
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I imagine the rooms are overheated, and I have not
been quite myself this evening,” she said, which was
true enough, for there had been a deadly sinking at her
heart ever since her encounter with her brother’s former
wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>She glanced uneasily toward the door as she spoke,
for she was in mortal terror lest she should chance to
make her appearance there in search of her daughter,
and she felt that she would rather drop dead, there
at her brother’s feet, than to have those two, so long
parted by her plotting, meet and become reconciled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her purpose now was to get him out of that house
and away from London as soon as possible, and she
resolved to stop at nothing to accomplish her object.
It was a terrible blow to her to find that woman there.
So many years had elapsed, during which she had
kept silence, that she had grown to feel very secure in
her position as mistress of her brother’s home, and
she had fully expected that she would retain it as long
as she should live, and had come to regard the threats
which the injured wife had made in the past as so
many idle words.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Life of late had looked brighter to her than at any
previous time since her marriage. Percy had recently
become engaged to a beautiful girl—one in every way
worthy of him, and who, when she became his wife,
would bring with her a noble dower; indeed, her
father was so much pleased with his prospective son-in-law
that he had himself proposed to relieve Linton
Grange of all incumbrances, and thus all the burden
entailed by his father’s profligacy would be lifted from
the young lord’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian’s <i><span lang="fr">début</span></i> in society had been very brilliant;
she was greatly admired and much sought after; so
the mother’s cup of pride and joy in her children
seemed to be full to the brim.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only bitter drop in it was Lillian’s unrequited
affection for Rupert, and Lady Linton had never relinquished
the hope of succeeding in accomplishing
even this marriage until after the young man’s return
from America.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had seemed very different since then; restless
and preoccupied, but betraying at the same time an
undercurrent of joy which told of some sweet hope
cherished in his heart, the fulfillment of which he
was eagerly awaiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>His treatment of Lillian was courteous and respectful,
but not calculated to inspire anyone with the belief
that he regarded her with feelings of more than ordinary
friendship, and thus Lady Linton had begun to
fear that her favorite and his magnificent fortune were
likely to slip from her grasp and become the prey of
some more fortunate beauty and belle.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not, however, had a suspicion of <em>who</em> was
to be the favored maiden, until she came so suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>upon that group in the Japanese parlor, when she had
taken in at a glance the mortifying and exasperating
truth, and immediately she was wrought almost into
a frenzy between anger and fear, and ready to adopt
the most daring measures to protect herself from exposure.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return to the Japanese parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton arose as she replied to her brother’s
questions, and signified her readiness to leave immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a moment here,” he said, “while I go to make
our excuses to Lady Dunforth  and tell Lillian that we
are going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—oh, do not leave me, William!” pleaded Lady
Linton, growing frightfully pale again and trembling
visibly; she would not trust him one moment in that
drawing-room, lest he should meet Virginia Alexander.
“I am afraid I shall have another fainting turn. Let
Rupert see her ladyship. Will you?” she asked, turning
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” he answered, readily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. And now, William, if you will please
ring for a servant to bring my wraps here. I do not
feel equal to the effort of going for them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William did as she requested, wondering to see
her so unnerved. Nothing had ever seemed to unsettle
her like this before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, Rupert,” she continued, “won’t you be so
good as to look after Lillian for the rest of the evening,
and see that she gets home safely?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do anything you wish,” the young man returned,
although he was not very well pleased with
this latter commission, for he had anticipated a pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>drive and chat with Virgie, as it had been his intention
to attend her home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do particularly wish this,” Lady Linton said,
with decision. “It would not be proper for Lillian to
come by herself, and I do not quite like to alarm her
or tear her away so early while she is enjoying herself
so much. Ah! here come my wraps,” she concluded,
with a sigh of relief, as a servant appeared with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>She put them on with nervous haste, and then turning
to her brother, said, almost peremptorily:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, William, I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In one moment, Miriam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had stepped back and was standing before Virgie,
who, keenly sensitive regarding Lady Linton’s
evident aversion to her, had withdrawn herself from
her immediate presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He held out his hand to her, saying, as he smiled
almost tenderly down on her upturned face:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been a great pleasure to me to meet you. I
trust we shall see each other again soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you will, Uncle Will,” Rupert interposed, in
a tone that made his guardian turn and regard him
searchingly, while he said to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do believe the young scamp is in love with her.
I would not wish a more charming little wife for him,
but I am afraid it will be rather hard on Lillian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Sir William,” Virgie returned, and there
was a slight tremor in her voice, for the presence of
this man thrilled her strangely. “I am sure the pleasure
has been mutual, and I should feel very sorry if
I thought I should not meet you again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“William!” interrupted his sister, impatiently; and
giving the soft hand he was holding a last, lingering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>pressure, the baronet turned away, with a sigh, and
attended his sister to her carriage, while Rupert took
Virgie to the drawing-room, where he sought Lillian,
to inform her of her mother’s sudden indisposition and
departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour later Mrs. Alexander and Virgie retired,
for the former was not strong yet, and therefore unequal
to very much dissipation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert attended them to their carriage, but just as
they were about to enter it an elegant coupe drew up
beside it, and Mrs. Alexander’s attention was instantly
attracted by a device that was emblazoned upon one
of its panels.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped with her foot upon the step, and turned
for a nearer view.</p>

<p class='c007'>A startled, surprised look came into her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coat of arms represented a patriarchal cross,
while underneath it there were stamped the words,
“<i><span lang="fr">Droit et Loyal.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whose carriage is that?” Mrs. Alexander asked
of Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'>He glanced in the direction indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is Lady Linton’s,” he replied; “she has sent
it back for Lillian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady Linton’s!” repeated Mrs. Alexander, with a
start, while she thought it a little strange that he
should speak so familiarly of her daughter and be so
well informed of the lady’s movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; Sir William Heath, her brother, presented
both carriage and horses to her for her individual use
one Christmas,” Rupert explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what is that device upon the panel of the
carriage door?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“It is the Linton coat of arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Linton coat of arms! You seem to know the
family well, Mr. Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why should I not?” Rupert returned, smiling.
“I have made my home with them during the last ten
or twelve years. William Heath is my guardian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried his listener, sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have I not told you before?” Rupert asked, looking
up in surprise at her tone. “You must pardon me,
Mrs. Alexander, for being so negligent; but surely, I
thought I had informed you of the fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander clutched at the carriage door for
support, and for a moment thought she must fall to the
ground; two such startling discoveries as she had just
made were sufficient to make her heart stand still and
her blood run cold, and she scarcely had strength to
move.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert Hamilton Sir William Heath’s ward?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a strange fate that had decreed that her
daughter and his should become the <i><span lang="fr">fiancée</span></i> of the
young man he had reared.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was aghast; her brain reeled and she stumbled
into the carriage and sank weakly upon the seat, anxious
to be gone, to be alone, and think it all out by
herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face was deathly in its paleness, and Rupert,
though he wondered at her strange behavior, so at
variance with her usual courtesy, feared that she was
displeased with him for his negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Am I forgiven?” he asked, smilingly, as he leaned
in to tuck the robes about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>His question brought the stricken woman somewhat
to herself, and she replied:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“There is nothing to forgive, Mr. Hamilton. Of
course, it was an oversight, your not mentioning that
Sir William Heath was your guardian. Did Virgie
know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mamma. Rupert introduced me to him to-night
as his best friend; but he had told me before, and
I thought you knew,” said the young girl, marveling at
her mother’s strange emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Introduced him to you to-night! Was he here?</em>”
cried the woman, with a gasp and a sense of suffocation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. But, mamma, how strangely you act! Are
you ill?” Virgie inquired, noticing, with increasing
alarm, her mother’s pale face and uncontrollable agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—yes. Let me get home as soon as we can—I
believe I am not well,” and she sank weakly back
among the cushions, almost panting for breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I come, too? Will you need me?” Rupert
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you,” Mrs. Alexander answered, with
a great effort. “It is not far—we shall soon be there—good-night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man would gladly have gone, but her
tone was decisive, and he turned back into the mansion,
as the carriage drove away, greatly puzzled by
her strange manner, and at the way she had spoken
of his guardian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander scarcely spoke all the way home,
and insisted upon going directly to her room alone,
although Virgie begged to be allowed to do something
for her—to stay with her during the night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“All that I need is rest and quiet,” she said. “Good-night
my darling!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She kissed her tenderly, wondering, with a terrible
heart-pang, how she could ever tell her that her
lover’s guardian was her own father—the man who
had so cruelly wronged his wife and child more than
eighteen years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once in the room, without even stopping to remove
her wraps, she went to her writing-desk, drew
forth a package from a drawer in it, and took it to
the light for examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the mysterious package which her uncle,
Mark Alexander, had confided to her on his death-bed,
charging her to return it to the owner should
she ever discover who that person was.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had discovered that night to whom it belonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>She held the seal close to the candle, and gazed
upon it with darkening eyes and sternly compressed
lips. It was stamped with a shield bearing a patriarchal
cross, and under it was the motto, “<i><span lang="fr">Droit et
Loyal</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How strange!” she murmured. “It belongs to his
sister—to that woman who mocked and scorned me;
whom I saved from a dreadful death, and nursed
through a critical illness! She must have been one of
those women whom Uncle Mark heard conversing together
that day in the hotel parlor here in London.
How wonderful that anything belonging to her should
have fallen into my hands! How wonderful everything
is—Virgie’s betrothal to Rupert—her meeting
with him to-night! How will it all end? To think that
he was there, in the same house with me, this evening!
I am really curious to know what this contains,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>she continued, turning the package over and over, and
regarding it with troubled eyes, while her thoughts
were busy with the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” she concluded, after musing for several
minutes, “it must be returned to its owner, I suppose.
I promised, and I must fulfill my word. Yes,” lifting
her head resolutely, “she shall have it on the day that
my darling stands within her ancestral halls the acknowledged
heiress of Heathdale, not before.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h2 id='XVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>A SUDDEN FLITTING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next morning Mrs. Alexander’s lawyer, Mr.
Thurston, made a call upon his client, and had an
interview with her of more than two hours’ duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his departure, she sought Virgie, with a very
grave face, and explained the nature of his business,
which caused the young girl to open wide her lovely
eyes and exclaim, with astonishment:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, mamma, it is the strangest romance in the
world! I never heard anything like it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, dear, get yourself ready as soon as possible,
for we must leave town this afternoon, as there is no
time to lose,” her mother replied, as she arose to go
to make her own preparations for the proposed journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, mamma, what shall I do about Rupert?” Virgie
asked, looking troubled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander’s face fell at the mention of the
young man’s name.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had scarcely slept during the previous night,
for many things troubled her, and, among others, the
thought that Virgie’s engagement to Rupert Hamilton
seemed likely to complicate matters very much
when she should be ready to make her claim upon Sir
William Heath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can leave a note telling him that we are
obliged to leave town for a while, and we can explain
further to him when we ascertain just how we are to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>be situated,” her mother replied, after considering a
moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, when Rupert called that evening, he found only
a note awaiting him instead of the bright face he had
hoped to see, while it told him that his betrothed and
her mother had been unexpectedly called away from
London upon important business, which might detain
them a week, perhaps longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very strange that she does not mention where
they are going,” he said, as he read the note over for
the second time, and remarked this omission. “Mrs.
Alexander acted very strangely last evening. I wonder
if this sudden departure can have had anything to do
with that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He retraced his steps, feeling unaccountably depressed
over the absence of Virgie, and he resolved
to seek an interview with Sir William and acquaint
him with the fact of his engagement that very evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not, however, find his guardian upon his
return; he had gone out upon a matter of business, his
valet told the young man, and would not be back
until late; so he retired, resolving to improve the first
opportunity on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, after breakfast, he said, in a
quiet aside:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can I have a few moments’ conversation with you,
Uncle Will?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, my boy. Come into the library in about
ten minutes, and I will be there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton, always on the alert for everything of
a mysterious nature, and doubly keen now to suspect
mischief, heard this request, and at once resolved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>become acquainted with the nature of the interview.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William’s chamber was just back of the library,
although there was no door communicating with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same furnace-pipe, however, conducted heat to
the two rooms, and, by stationing herself close to this,
her ladyship knew she could overhear whatever might
pass between the two men. She therefore slipped
quietly into her brother’s bed-room, locked the door,
and, creeping close to the register, laid her eager ear
against it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert was already with Sir William, for the housekeeper
had detained Lady Linton for a few moments
with questions regarding some domestic matter, but
she was in season to hear him broach the subject
so near his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have come to make a confession to you, Uncle
Will,” he said, as he seated himself opposite his guardian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A confession! Nothing very serious, I hope,” said
Sir William, glancing keenly into the flushed face of
his ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I think it is of rather a serious nature,” he
returned, smiling slightly. “I wish to tell you that I
have become deeply attached to Miss Alexander, to
whom I introduced you last night, and to ask your
sanction to our engagement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! has it gone so far as that?” inquired Sir
William. “I began to surmise last evening that she
was taking your heart captive, but did not imagine
matters had reached a crisis yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think her lovely, Uncle Will?” Rupert
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very lovely; but, my boy, the ocean rolls between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>England and America. I cannot bear the thought of
a separation from you, Rupert.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I from you, my dear guardian; and, I assure
you, you need not fear it, for the young lady does not
object to a permanent residence in England. I trust
you will not oppose my marriage with Miss Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rupert,” said Sir William, gravely, “my only wish
is for your happiness, and if Miss Alexander is the
woman of your choice—if you are sure that she alone
can make you happy—then I can only say Heaven
bless you and grant that your future may be all that
you desire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Uncle Will, I—I hope you do not disapprove
of my choice of a wife?” Rupert said, regarding
his guardian’s grave face anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” returned the baronet, hastily. “I admired
the little lady very much during the few moments that
I spent with her last evening. She seems a lovely
girl. My first thought was that she might take you
from us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Although she was born in America, she is
herself of English decent on her father’s side, and she
and her mother are now in this country, for the purpose
of claiming some property inherited from him,”
Rupert explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! then she has no father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he—she—lost him when she was a child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man began to fear he was trespassing
somewhat upon Mrs. Alexander’s confidence, and resolved
that he would betray no more at present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you sure that the family is one with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>you will feel proud to ally yourself?” Sir William inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know but very little concerning their family,”
Rupert admitted. “I doubt if they have any, but
everything about them indicates that they are above
reproach, while Mr. Knight, the gentleman whom I
met in America, and of whom you have often heard
me speak, introduced them, and he is of irreproachable
character. He occupies a high position in New York,
and it is in compliance with his request that they are
presented here, and chaperoned by the Huntingtons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Huntingtons are all right, and would introduce
no one regarding whom there was any question,”
Sir William said, in a satisfied tone. “Is Mrs. Alexander
as much of a beauty as her daughter?” he concluded,
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly in my eyes,” returned the young man, with
heightened color; “and yet she is a remarkably handsome
woman. I hope I may be able to arrange for
you to make their acquaintance very soon; but until
then please regard what I have told you as strictly
confidential.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Then you do not intend to announce your engagement
just yet,” remarked Sir William, with some
surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir. At Mrs. Alexander’s request, we shall delay
it for the present, until she secures the property of
which I have already spoken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much of an heiress is your pretty <i><span lang="fr">fiancée</span></i> going
to be, Rupert?” his guardian asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot tell. I do not even know of what this
property consists,” the young man answered, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“I am afraid there is something a little mysterious
about these ladies. Doesn’t it strike you so?” inquired
Sir William, gravely, yet without a suspicion of the
wonderful truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert knew there was, but he was not going to
confess it, and he replied, evasively:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not imagine there is anything but what will
soon be satisfactorily explained to us all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton, hearing all this, and knowing so much
more than either Rupert or her brother, grew deadly
faint as she listened and realized how near she stood
to the verge of a terrible exposure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then there came a brisk tap on the library
door, and the next moment Lillian put her bright face
into the room, and looking as lovely as the morning
itself in her white flannel wrapper, fastened at the
waist with cherry ribbons, and with her hands full
of jacqueminot roses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face assumed a look of surprise as she saw
Rupert there, and she regarded him with searching
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me, Uncle Will,” she said, flushing; “I did
not know that you were engaged with anyone; I have
just received a box of flowers, and came to arrange
some for your table. May I come in? I won’t be long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed, come in; you are doubly welcome
coming with so much beauty and fragrance,” said her
uncle, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert arose as she entered, and asked with an arch
smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What enamored swain has been guilty of the extravagance
of lavishing such costly flowers upon you,
Lillian?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Lord Ernest Rathburn is the donor; he has exquisite
taste. I wish you could have seen the box when
it came,” the girl replied, with a conscious drooping
of her brilliant eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Ernest Rathburn!” repeated Rupert in a peculiar
tone, which brought the angry color to Lillian’s
cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Ernest was a young nobleman with a large
revenue, but possessing far less brains than mustache,
and who was regarded with contempt by all manly
young men, on account of his effeminacy and excesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish,” he added, “that you could meet a friend
of mine, Lillian; you will, I hope, before very long.
Lord Ernest would sink into insignificance by comparison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who may this paragon of manly excellence be,
Mr. Hamilton, if I may inquire?” Lillian asked, with a
toss of her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harry Webster, the young man with whom I traveled,
last winter, in America.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I despise Americans,” retorted Miss Linton, with
considerable asperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is rather a sweeping assertion; isn’t it, my
dear?” asked Sir William, looking a trifle amused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the truth, Uncle Will, whatever else it may
be,” she retorted, as she began to arrange her flowers
in a vase on the table. “I am English to the backbone.
I am thoroughly imbued with a love for my
own people, and I shall never permit myself to draw
disloyal comparisons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert laughed outright as, in his mind, he placed
the stooping figure and imbecile face of the halfwitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>young lord beside the grandly developed form
and frank, handsome countenance of his American
friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you could place the two men side by side, I
warrant you would be compelled to draw disloyal
comparisons, in spite of your very praiseworthy patriotism,
my fair cousin,” he said, a roguish twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian shot an angry glance at those last words;
nothing annoyed her more than to be called “sister”
or “cousin” by Rupert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you for acknowledging that I am imbued
with patriotism. I wonder what has become of yours,”
she said, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have plenty of it, only I do not allow it to warp
my judgment; I can appreciate both beauty and goodness
whenever I find it, at home or abroad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a self-evident fact,” remarked the young
girl, dryly, and Rupert colored consciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I give you credit for just as nice discrimination,”
he retorted. “Wait till you see my friend, Webster,
and if he doesn’t take the palm I shall ‘lose my guess,’
as the Yankees say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is American slang; they are all insufferably
coarse,” Lillian returned, contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you meet the pretty little American, Miss
Alexander, at Lady Dunforth’s the other evening, Lillian?”
inquired Sir William.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I met her,” the girl admitted, rather ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you would hardly class her among those
whom you term coarse, would you? I thought her an
unusually attractive girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“No; I admit she appeared very pretty and lady-like
and yet I have no doubt that she would soon betray
her nationality if one was to see much of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither have I; and she would be proud to own it,
also, I’ll wager,” Rupert observed, with some spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was out of patience with Lillian’s unreasonable
prejudices, and her slighting tone in speaking
of Virgie made him indignant.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at him with a mocking smile on her red
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When shall we have the pleasure of congratulating
you upon your American conquest?” she asked,
saucily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall take great pleasure in informing you when
the proper time arrives,” he replied, with studied
politeness, and with a seriousness that drove all color
from the girl’s face and made her heart sink like lead
in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment the butler entered the room with
a telegram, which he presented to Sir William, and
then withdrew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baronet tore it open and read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come to Middlewich at once. William has had
a dangerous fall.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Margaret Heath.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Middlewich was the country seat of the nobleman
to whom the baronet’s cousin, William Heath, was
private secretary, and it was to this place that he was
now so peremptorily summoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton, in her hiding place, heard her brother
read this telegram with a thrill of joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was glad of anything that would take him out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of London and away from the danger of meeting
“that woman,” and she resolved that it should go
hard with her if she could not find some way of opposing
other barriers before his return. It was a desperate
case, and she was prepared for desperate measures.</p>

<p class='c007'>She crept out of her brother’s  chamber with a pale,
drawn face, saying to herself that Rupert Hamilton
should never fulfill his engagement with Virgie Alexander,
if there was any power on earth to prevent it;
she could never bear the humiliation of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She packed her brother’s portmanteau with alacrity,
and promised to attend faithfully to his various commissions
during his absence, and uttered a sigh of
relief when the carriage drove from the door, and she
knew that he was well on his way to Middlewich.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h2 id='XIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Three days later Lady Linton received a letter from
her brother, giving the particulars of his cousin’s accident.
He had been riding from Chester to Middlewich,
when his horse became frightened at some object
by the roadside, and Mr. Heath, not being sufficiently
on his guard, had been thrown, suffering the
fracture of two ribs, a broken arm, and, it was feared,
some internal injury besides. He was in a very critical
state at the time of Sir William’s writing, and the latter
said he should not think of returning to London
until assured that his kinsman was out of danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank fortune!” Lady Linton breathed, most fervently.
“Of course,” she added, a guilty flush rising
to her forehead as she suddenly realized how heartless
her expression sounded, “of course, I do not mean that
I am thankful to have Cousin William suffer such injuries,
but I am immeasurably relieved to have my
brother called away just at this time, and the longer
he stays, the better I shall be pleased.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She heard nothing more for a week, when there
came another letter stating that Mr. Heath was
slightly improved, but still unable to be moved, and
quite a sufferer. There were some more particulars,
too, regarding the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Norton, an aged friend of the Duke of Falmouth—the
nobleman to whom Mr. Heath was private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>secretary—was very ill, and he had sent for his
grace to confide to him a historical work upon which
he had been engaged for more than two years. It
was nearly completed, only a few more chapters to be
copied, and Lord Norton, feeling that he should not
live to see it published, desired his friend to take charge
of it, finish it, and secure its publication.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duke readily consented to put the work
through; but, as his eyesight would not permit him to
do very much in the way of either reading or writing,
he suggested that his secretary, Mr. Heath, who
was eminently qualified, should get it ready for press,
and he himself would attend to its publication.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Norton was pleased with this proposition, and
Mr. Heath consented to take hold of the book at once,
hoping to complete the copying while his lordship’s
strength endured to oversee the work and make important
suggestions for his benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, this necessitated numerous visits to the
invalid, and it was while returning from one of these
that Mr. Heath’s horse took fright, causing the accident
and putting a stop to the project which lay so
near the old lord’s heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William wrote that the disappointment of both
the Duke of Falmouth and Lord Norton was so great
that he had himself offered to take his cousin’s place
and finish the copying of the book, while he remained
at Middlewich in attendance upon his injured relative
and his family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton was jubilant after receiving this letter,
for it was evident that Sir William would be detained
at Middlewich for quite a while; meantime she
would exert all the cunning of which she was mistress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to ruin the  woman whom she both feared and
hated, and thus plant an insurmountable barrier between
Rupert and his beautiful <i><span lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this mad scheme in mind, she ascertained Mrs.
Alexander’s address, and boldly went one morning to
face her enemy in her own domain.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she was bitterly disappointed to learn that she
was not in town. She was away on a little trip, the
landlady told her; she might be gone a week longer;
she might not return even at the end of that time.
“The rooms were paid for in advance for three months,
so the woman had not asked when they would return,
nor whither they were going, but she had heard the
young lady say something about a visit to Edinburgh;
possibly they had gone there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Lady Linton had to rest on her belligerent oars
for a season, though she resolved to be on the alert
to act as soon as Mrs. Alexander and her daughter
should return.</p>

<p class='c007'>A couple of weeks later she went one morning to
do some shopping for Lillian on Oxford street, and
just as she was about to enter a fashionable furnishing
store the door opened, a lady came out, and—she
stood face to face once more with Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c007'>An angry red suffused Lady Linton’s face, an ominous
flash lighted her cold, gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! so you have returned,” she said, sharply, and
planting herself directly in the path of her foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was looking very lovely—so lovely, indeed, that
her ladyship marveled at her beauty. She wore a
black silk dress, simply made, but of richest texture,
an elegant mantle of black velvet heavily trimmed
with jet, a bonnet of the same material, relieved by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>three graceful ostrich tips of cream-white; and the
dainty affair was bewitchingly becoming; her hands
were faultlessly gloved, and a single half-blown Lamargue
rose had been drawn into one of the fastenings
of her mantle, its pale yellow petals nestling lovingly
among the rich folds of velvet. There was the
daintiest bloom on her cheeks, her eyes were bright,
her whole face animated, and she was a woman to attract
admiring attention wherever she went.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton congratulated herself that her brother
was far from London, for she well knew that it would
need but one glance at this beautiful picture to bring
him a hopeless captive to her feet once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander slightly raised her brows at her
ladyship’s abrupt manner of address, bowed politely,
and would have passed on, but the other laid a detaining
hand upon her arm, and drew her into a little
vestibule just inside the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to speak to you,” she said, authoritatively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly; I am at your service, Lady Linton,”
was the quiet, lady-like reply, and Virgie’s full, blue
eyes looked calmly down upon the sallow countenance
before her, as she waited to learn why she had
been so unceremoniously detained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why have you come to London?” Lady Linton inquired,
brusquely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander drew herself up a trifle, and hesitated
a moment before replying; then she said,
gravely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partly upon business; partly for health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Health!” scornfully repeated Lady Linton, with
a quick upward glance into that beautiful, blooming
face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>A musical laugh rippled over Mrs. Alexander’s lips,
and she flushed an exquisite color; for both glance
and emphasis, although not so intended, were a
marked compliment to her appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think I do not need to go anywhere in search
of health,” she observed. “That is true, just now, although
I was far from well when I left America.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your ‘business’ here?” demanded her companion,
ignoring her reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, Lady Linton,” Mrs. Alexander returned,
coldly, “I do not know as I feel obliged to explain that
to you just yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just yet!” repeated the other, with a sudden heart-bound.
“What am I to understand by that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just what you choose, Lady Linton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is your ‘business’ connected in any way with that
threat which you made in my presence more than
eight years ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! then you have not forgotten what happened
more than eight years ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton colored angrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could almost wish that I had died then, rather
than that you should have saved me!” she said, passionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravely, almost solemnly, the brief inquiry was
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I hate you! You came between me and
some of my brightest hopes. Because you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it is not wholly that,” Virgie interposed quietly,
while her grave, beautiful eyes searched Lady Linton’s
face, with something of pity in them: “It is because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>you have injured me, and one is apt to dislike
and shrink from another whom one has wronged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How have I wronged you?” demanded Lady Linton,
in a startled tone, and wondering how much the
woman knew.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not need to tell you. Your own conscience
needs no other accuser than itself,” was the calm reply.
“But it would have been far better had your
ladyship constituted yourself my friend instead of my
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could never be your friend. I shall be your foe
to the bitter end, and it was to warn you of this that
I detained you to-day. If you have come to London
with the intention of thrusting yourself and your
daughter upon my brother, let me tell you to beware!
You are a divorced woman; you have no claim whatever
upon Sir William Heath, and your child shall
never be acknowledged by his name. I have vowed
this, and I mean it. You may think it all an idle threat,
but if you are in London one month from to-day it will
be at your peril. I will ruin you. I will so shame
and humiliate you that you will be glad to hide yourself
from all who know you. I will do even worse if
need be. Nothing shall hinder me from making sure
work this time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was actually hoarse with passion as she concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This time, Lady Linton? Then it was your work
that other time. You acknowledge it?” said Mrs.
Alexander, in a calm tone, and without a trace of excitement
in either face or manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was as unruffled as when Lady Linton first met
her; she had not even lost a vestige of color. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>change that was visible in her was a half-sorrowful
light in her beautiful blue eyes, a grave, pitiful expression
about her mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton saw instantly that she had made a mistake;
in her anger and hatred she had admitted more
than was wise or prudent, and she grew very pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I acknowledge nothing; I only warn you,” she said,
almost fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady Linton,” her companion answered composedly,
“your threats do not move me; they cannot
hurt me, and I fear they will but recoil upon your
own head. Believe me, I would much rather be upon
friendly terms with you. I feel more like forgiving the
injuries of the past than cherishing hostile feelings.
I could even at this moment take your hand—the
hand that wrote such cruel things of me so many years
ago—and say, ‘Let us be at peace;’ but you will not,
and I must go my way and leave you to go yours,
hoping that before it is too late for repentance to avail
you anything, a better spirit may possess you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You defy me then?” said Lady Linton, through
tightly closed teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; I do not defy you,” was the pleasant rejoinder.
“You are very angry, Lady Linton, because
I will not allow myself to be frightened and browbeaten
by you, but you will feel differently by and by
when you come to consider matters in another light.
I would rather do you a kindness than harm, and, by
the way, I have a package belonging to you which I
mean to return to you very soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A package belonging to me! Where did you get
it?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“It is one that I have had many years, but I have
only recently discovered that it is yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is impossible that you can have anything of
mine,” returned Lady Linton, coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her companion smiled slightly, then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“An uncle of mine was returning from the far East
some twelve or thirteen years ago, and, on his way
from London to Edinburgh, rode in the same railway
carriage with a lady who got out at one of the way
stations. He never knew which station it was, for he
had fallen asleep shortly after leaving London, and
when he awoke she was gone. He found a package,
however, which she had dropped and which he could
not return, because there was no name upon it, therefore
he was forced to take it home to America with
him. He confided it to me on his death-bed with the
injunction to return it to the owner if I should ever
be so fortunate as to meet her. I discovered on the
evening of our meeting at Lady Dunforth’s that you
were the owner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I assure you that you are mistaken. I never lost
a package in a railway carriage,” returned Lady Linton,
haughtily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but a friend to whom you confided it, lost it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What—who?” demanded her ladyship, with a start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The way I learned that it belonged to you,” Mrs.
Alexander resumed, “was by observing upon the panel
of your carriage door, as I left Lady Dunforth’s that
evening, the Linton coat of arms. The seal upon the
package of which I speak is stamped with a shield
bearing a patriarchal cross and the motto ‘<i><span lang="fr">Droit et
Loyal</span></i>,’ and there is also written upon the wrapper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>this sentence, ‘To be destroyed unopened in the event
of my death.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton had shrunk back appalled during this
description, and now stood leaning against the wall,
white, trembling while great beads of perspiration
stood about her mouth and on her forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great heavens! have you got that?” at last burst
from her quivering lips, in a tone or horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! it is a singular coincidence, is it not?” inquired
her companion, serenely. “However, I will return
it to you very soon. And now, good-morning,
Lady Linton. This will be a very busy day for me,
and I must not tarry longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, Virginia Alexander swept by the
stricken woman with a courteous inclination of her
head, and went on her way, apparently unruffled by
anything that had occurred during the spirited interview
with her sworn enemy, Sir William Heath’s sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton stood for a moment or two utterly
motionless, almost paralyzed by the startling revelations
which her brother’s former wife had just made
to her, and then she, too, tottered from the place, murmuring:</p>

<p class='c007'>“To think that she, of all persons, should have had
that during these years! What a fool I have been!
But,” she continued, with an ominous glitter in her
steely eyes, “the die is cast—it will now take desperate
measures indeed to secure my own safety and accomplish
her defeat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She returned directly home, for she had neither the
strength nor the heart to purchase fashionable gewgaws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>for Lillian; at least until she had recovered
somewhat from the shock she had just received.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon her arrival she found still another letter from
Sir William awaiting her, and one which filled her
with astonishment and put an entirely different aspect
upon the future, while a portion, at least, of its contents
was calculated to electrify his whole household
as well as society at large.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h2 id='XX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='large'>A STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lady Linton’s letter was handed to her by the butler
just as she was sitting down to lunch.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had come in just as the bell rang, and leaving
her bonnet and wraps in the hall, went directly to the
dining-room without going, as usual, to her room to
make a change in her toilet; she was far too weary
and shaken to mount the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>She broke the seal absently, and began to read in a
listless, preoccupied way, when all at once she uttered
a startled exclamation, and the paper dropped from
her nerveless fingers upon the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, mamma, what is it? You are as pale as a
ghost. Is Cousin William worse or—dead?” exclaimed
Lillian, regarding her mother with mingled
curiosity and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but the strangest thing in the world has happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be something strange to disturb your
equanimity like this; but what is it?” inquired the girl,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Uncle William is going to be married!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You cannot mean it, mamma?—at last!” cried Lillian,
amazed; then she added, with a gay laugh: “The
dear old bachelor! Well, you will have your wish, after
all. You have wanted him to marry for the last dozen
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Yes; and—I am glad—I am delighted!” replied
Lady Linton, slowly, but with strange exultation in
her voice, while her eyes gleamed with almost ferocious
triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I am astonished. I had given Uncle Will up
as a hardened case,” Lillian said, growing more and
more surprised, as she considered the matter; “but do
tell me who is the happy woman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A niece of Lord Norton who has just died; you
know we read of his death last week, and I have been
wondering why your uncle did not write. This accounts
for it,” replied Lady Linton. Then taking up
his letter, she continued: “I will read you what he
says. The epistle is very brief, and does not sound
like him at all, but I suppose we must excuse it under
the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You will doubtless be surprised by the contents
of this letter,’ he writes, ‘and as I have much on my
mind, I will simply state bare facts, leaving details
until my return. You already know of my having
taken my cousin’s place as temporary amanuensis to
Lord Norton. I was enabled to complete the manuscript
for him the week before his death, which occurred
on the ninth. But, during my visits to him, I
met a niece of his, who, I may say, is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen. By his lordship’s will
she becomes the heiress to all his possessions, which
consist of his fine estate called Englewood, here in
Chester, besides a large amount of personal property.
To make a long story short, however, I am going to
make this lady my wife, and as I am too old to waste
any time upon forms or so-called etiquette, we intend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to be married immediately—that is, within the month—about
the twenty-first, I think, after which we shall
repair to Heathdale, where we shall quietly remain
for the present. The wedding will be strictly private
on account of his lordship’s recent death and in compliance
with the request of his niece. I will, however,
notify you further of my plans before the twenty-first.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>The epistle closed abruptly and rather formally, and
Lady Linton’s face was crimson as she concluded the
reading of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the most unheard of thing in the world!” she
said, excitedly. “A private wedding, indeed—not even
his own sister invited, and it is all so sudden that it
fairly takes my breath away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They might at least have asked us to go to Englewood
to witness the ceremony,” Lillian observed,
thoughtfully. “The letter doesn’t sound a bit like
Uncle Will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose he is so taken up with his bride-elect
that he has not much time or thought for any one
else; but he might have told us something about her;
he did not even mention her name; I suppose, however,
we are to infer that she is a Miss Norton. I
wonder whether she is young or old?” Lady Linton
said, in an injured tone, and looking both perplexed
and annoyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says she is beautiful, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course; one’s betrothed is always beautiful to
the man who is to be married. They are going directly
to Heathdale,” she added, musingly. “There ought to
be some one there to receive them, and the house needs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>preparation for the occasion. I think, Lillian, that,
notwithstanding I have been rather shabbily treated
in this affair, I shall go down to Heathdale and give
them the best welcome possible at so short a notice. I
can at least brighten things up and arrange for a small
dinner-party and reception in honor of the bride.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps they would prefer not to meet anyone just
yet, mamma,” Lillian suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot help it. Such a home-coming as that
would be too dismal, and not at all in keeping with the
dignity of the family. I shall take matters into my
own hands and conduct the affair as I think best. We
will go to Heathdale the last of the week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her ladyship fell into a profound reverie after announcing
this decision, while Lillian took up the morning
paper and began to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton was deeply hurt by the way that her
brother had written of his approaching marriage, and
more so at having been ignored in all the arrangements;
yet in spite of all this she was secretly jubilant
over the fact that Sir William was about to bring a
mistress to Heathdale. It would relieve her of a great
burden; of all further plotting and intrigue regarding
the enemy whom she had encountered only that day.
Virginia Alexander might do her worst now—once
let the twenty-first of December pass and she need
fear her no more. She might succeed in securing an
acknowledgment from Sir William that Virgie was his
lawful child and a settlement of a portion of his property
upon her; but there would be no longer any fear
of the long-parted husband and wife coming to an understanding
with each other—she, at least, would
never come to Heathdale to queen it as mistress.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>She had heard of Lord Norton. He was reputed to
be very old, very eccentric, and very literary; but she
had not known of what his family consisted. She
did not know, even now, farther than that he had a
niece, but in her present mood, with that bitter hatred
against Virginia Alexander rankling in her heart and
the fear that her own past treachery was liable to be
exposed if she was ever allowed to enter Heathdale,
she was prepared to welcome Lord Norton’s heiress
in the most cordial manner, and her spirits rose light
as air at the prospect of a new sister-in-law.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma,” said Lillian, suddenly looking up from
her paper and breaking in upon these musings, “Uncle
Will’s engagement is announced here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! in the paper? Well, I must say they are
rushing things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She held out her hand for the sheet, an evil smile
on her thin lips, as she imagined something of the chagrin
and disappointment that Mrs. Alexander would
experience upon reading an account of Sir William
Heath’s approaching marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was quite an extended paragraph regarding
it, considerable being said about the late Lord Norton
and his recent death; mention being made of his having
left the whole of his large property to a niece;
while the fact that Sir William Heath was contemplating
matrimony with the “beautiful heiress,” gave
rise to some pleasantry, since the “distinguished baronet
having for so many years resisted Cupid’s most
artful endeavors to lead him to Hymen’s altar, his
friends and well-wishers had begun to fear that he
was hopelessly invulnerable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, what will become of us when Uncle Will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>brings his wife home?” Lillian asked, somewhat anxiously,
as Lady Linton laid down the paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same question had been agitating her ladyship’s
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>They could not well go to Linton Grange, for Percy
was making extensive improvements in view of his
own approaching marriage; they had no home of their
own—in fact they were wholly dependent upon Sir
William, and Lady Linton felt that no place but
Heathdale would ever be like home to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will not borrow trouble about that, Lillian,”
she answered, “this Miss Norton may be very young
and inexperienced; in that case she would need some
older person, like myself, to advise and assist her; so
I imagine that we shall still be welcome in your
uncle’s household.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening, at a dinner-party, Lady Linton was
besieged by numerous friends with questions regarding
her brother’s engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked wise, and appeared as if she had been in
the secret for some time but had not been allowed to
divulge anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true, she admitted, that the marriage was
rather a sudden one; but of course it could not have
occurred before, because of Lord Norton’s critical condition,
and there was no reason now why it should not
take place, except for etiquette’s sake, and her
brother did not propose to defer their happiness simply
to observe a law of fashion. They would not,
however, appear in society at present, she affirmed,
but remain quietly at Heathdale, perhaps until another
season, while there would only be an informal
reception of their oldest friends, at their home-coming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and to arrange for this she was herself going to Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>She appeared to be very much elated over the marriage,
spoke eloquently of the bride-elect, of her grace,
beauty, and intelligence; for she was far too proud to
allow it to be known that she had been taken as much
by surprise as society at large by the announcement
of the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Mrs. Farnum alone she acknowledged it; for that
lady called the next day, and had asked her point-blank
some questions which she could not answer, and
she had been obliged to confess that she “did not
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Miriam,” said her friend, “it is rather hard
on you, I own, not to be consulted, or even asked to
the wedding, but your heart will be set at rest on one
subject—you need not fear that Alexander woman any
more after the twenty-first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; she may do her worst then. I have lived in
daily terror lest she should meet William and everything
would be explained. What do you think, Myra?”
asked Lady Linton, suddenly. “She has got that
diary!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What diary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That one I gave to you to keep for me, the summer
I was on the Continent—the diary you lost!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miriam Linton! how came she by it?” cried Mrs.
Farnum, aghast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She says her uncle was in the railway carriage
with you when you left London that afternoon after
I had met you at the —— Hotel, and you dropped it in
the coach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I am at least glad to know <em>how</em> I lost it,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>returned her friend, in a relieved tone. “It has been
a most annoying mystery to me all these years. Does
she know what there is in it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know,” Lady Linton said, growing pale.
“I met her yesterday on Oxford street, when she told
me she had it, and would return it soon. If she has
not opened the package, I am all right; if she has,
and ever sees fit to betray me to Sir William, it will be
a sad day for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were very foolish ever to commit to paper
anything concerning that American escapade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I was, but I always keep a diary; there
are many things of importance that I like to remember
accurately, and a diary is so convenient to refer
to—it has saved me many mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would have been far better if you had destroyed
<em>that</em> year’s notes, as I advised you,” returned Mrs.
Farnum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was full of important data, and I never
dreamed that anything could happen to it—it was very
careless of you to lose it,” said her ladyship, complainingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it was, and I have suffered a great deal of
anxiety on account of it; for, of course, with all those
names and dates, I am implicated almost as much as
yourself. Why don’t you go around to her lodgings
and get it at once?—your mind will be at rest then.
If the seal has never been broken, you are as safe as
if it had never been lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True; I believe I will,” Lady Linton answered,
brightening.</p>

<p class='c007'>She followed the advice of her friend the very next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>day, and, calling at Mrs. Alexander’s lodgings, was
shown at once up to her private parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no one there when she entered, but presently
Virgie came in, looking charming in her morning
robe of mauve cashmere, with blue silk facings,
and greeted her ladyship politely, although with some
reserve.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wished to see mamma,” she said, “but I am
obliged to receive you as she is not in just now. Can
I do anything for you, Lady Linton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wished to see Mrs. Alexander personally,” returned
Lady Linton, haughtily. “Will she return
soon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid not. She had an engagement with
Madame Gerbier, her modiste, at eleven, and one with
her lawyer at one,” Virgie explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton thought a moment, then she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Alexander told me, a day or two ago, that
she had a package belonging to me; do you know anything
about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A package?” repeated Virgie, looking mystified;
then she added, quickly, “Oh! perhaps it is that sealed
package that mamma’s uncle found so long ago. Is
that yours, Lady Linton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Sealed!—did you say it is <em>sealed</em>?” asked the
woman, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is sealed with a strange device and motto.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And has it never been opened?” was the eager
query.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not; it is just as mamma’s uncle found
it,” Virgie responded, with curling lips, and flushing
indignantly at the implied suspicion of the woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton could have wept for joy. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>saved! her vile secrets were still all her own; and if
she could but get that coveted diary into her possession
once again, she had nothing to fear; she would
burn it without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry to miss Mrs. Alexander; but perhaps
<em>you</em> could get it for me?” she said, insinuatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think I should like to do that without
mamma’s sanction,” Virgie answered; “but I will tell
her your errand, and no doubt she will take measures
to return the package to you at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” replied Lady Linton; “tell her to send
it immediately to my brother’s residence; the street
and number are on my card, which you have. I shall
leave town to-morrow, and would like it before I go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie promised to deliver the message, and her
ladyship took her leave, with a heart lighter than she
had known for years, for the burden of a great dread
had been rolled from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she did not receive the package before leaving
for Heathdale, as she had confidently expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had arranged to go on the fifteenth, taking Lillian
with her, and although she waited until the last
minute, hoping for the appearance of her long-lost
diary, she was obliged to depart without it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not worry over it very much, however, for
she told herself that if it had been kept all these years
with the seal unbroken, there was not much danger
of its being disturbed at this late day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as she was about to enter the carriage there arrived
a telegram from her brother. It contained just
two lines:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Shall leave Englewood Wednesday noon; arrive
at Heathdale on the 7:30 express. Meet us there if
you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rather a curt bidding to a wedding feast,” Lady
Linton sarcastically observed, showing it to her
daughter; but she would have been more than content
had she not been bidden at all, for her brother’s
marriage was, to her, an unlooked-for triumph over
her enemy, a release from a much dreaded doom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h2 id='XXI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='large'>THE ARRIVAL AT HEATHDALE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Upon her arrival at Heathdale, Lady Linton was
considerably surprised to find that Sir William had
engaged the services of a professional decorator to
prepare his home for the reception of his bride, and
great improvements had been made in many of the
rooms. The suite over the library, and looking out
upon the river, had been exquisitely fitted up in blue
and white, and gold for his wife’s special use, while
several new pictures and pieces of statuary had been
added to the already choice collection which the old
mansion possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still, with all this added elegance, it needed the
touch of a tasteful woman’s hand to make it really
home-like, and both Lady Linton and her daughter
exerted themselves to make everything as attractive
as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her ladyship realized that perhaps she was presuming
a little beyond her jurisdiction in arranging,
unauthorized, for a dinner-party, but she was determined
to do honor to the new mistress of Heathdale,
and to show her brother her entire approval of the
step he had taken. She was bound, too, that no
funereal gloom should hang over their first evening at
home, but that all things should wear a joyous and inviting
aspect; so she sent invitations to a select few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to come and welcome the baronet and his bride upon
their arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eventful day at length dawned—a bright,
beautiful winter’s day, yet mild for the season, and,
at an early hour, the household at Heathdale was all
astir, and preparations for the grand event went
briskly forward; for everyone, down to the lowest
servant, loved the master, and was eager to show him
honor on this unlooked-for occasion, while all were
on the alert to learn what manner of a wife he was
about to bring home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The state dining-room was handsomely decorated
for the grand event; the best plate had been polished
to the last degree of brightness, the finest linen
bleached and pressed, and a most sumptuous dinner
was in preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were flowers, choice and rare, everywhere,
and every room was fragrant with their perfume and
bright with their beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glowing fire was built in the great hall, while over
the carved mantle above the huge fire-place, Lady
Linton had caused to be placed a beautiful shield, representing
the crest of her family, and composed of
lilies and roses, with the word “Welcome,” in immortelles,
surmounting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At seven o’clock the guests began to gather; there
were the Hon. Mr. Capron with his wife and daughter,
from an adjoining estate. The rector and his genial
helpmate; Lord Alfred Hartington, and his sister;
Percy Linton and his charming <i><span lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>; Mrs. Farnum
with Lord and Lady Royalston. Rupert had of course
been included in the list, but, not having yet arrived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>was looked for on the train from London, that was
due a few minutes before the one from the west.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton was magnificent in garnet velvet, point
lace, and diamonds. She had spared neither time nor
money for the occasion, and really had never looked
so well as now.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian wore simple white silk, with crimson roses,
in which she was brilliantly handsome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the party were equally well arrayed,
and it was truly a goodly company that gathered
to welcome the Baron of Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>At precisely a quarter to eight a carriage was heard
to arrive, and Lady Linton hastened to the hall to be
the first to welcome her brother and his wife; but she
started back, almost affrighted, as she beheld instead,
William Heath, looking pale and thin, but bright and
smiling, enter, leaning upon Rupert Hamilton’s arm,
and followed by his wife and son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is my brother?” she inquired, after greeting
them all most cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert smiled roguishly as he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have achieved a flank movement upon you,
Lady Linton; when they saw the house ablaze, they
suspected a reception, and as a bride would naturally
be somewhat sensitive about appearing before company
in travel-stained garments, Sir William and Lady
Heath drove to the side-entrance, and doubtless are
now in their own rooms. I am commissioned to make
their excuses, and to beg that you will send word
when dinner will be served.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton at once dispatched a servant to tell
his master that dinner had been ordered at nine
o’clock, but it could be delayed if he desired.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Sir William returned answer not to make any
change, that he and Lady Heath would be ready to
meet their friends by half-past eight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time would have passed heavily after that,
had it not been for Rupert, who was a general favorite,
and soon had the whole company in the best possible
humor with themselves and everybody else, and
Lady Linton blessed him in her heart for his genial
mirth, his exhaustless fund of anecdote and repartee.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was very restless, however, and anxiously
watched the clock upon the mantle, while it seemed
as if half-past eight would never arrive.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once she saw Rupert dart from the side of
Lillian, with whom he had been talking, toward the
lower door of the drawing-room, and disappear in the
hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there came a murmur of surprise from the
opposite direction, and glancing toward the upper
door, she saw Sir William standing there, smiling and
looking the personification of joy, with a beautiful
woman leaning upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton started eagerly forward to greet
them, when, all at once, her heart bounded into her
throat with suffocating force, a blur came before her
eyes, her limbs trembled and almost sank beneath
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>What delusion was this—what trick of her fancy?</p>

<p class='c007'>Was it a horrible nightmare, or had some sorceress
suddenly bewitched her sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>She covered her eyes with her hand for a moment,
and then looked again.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, it was no delusion—it was no trick; for just
before her, looking like a queen in her rich robes, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>face radiant with happiness as she leaned proudly
upon her husband’s arm, she saw the woman who she
had hated and wronged for long, long years; whom she
had plotted to ruin and sweep from her path forever—Virginia
Alexander! the chosen bride of her brother
in his youth, and now, in spite of falsehood, calumny,
treachery and even divorce, his happy wife, and the
mistress of Heathdale!</p>

<p class='c007'>She was clad in a reception robe of pale lavender
velvet, simply piped with satin; it faultlessly fitted her
perfect form, while its ample train, sweeping out behind
her, made her stately figure seem more regal
than usual. Diamonds of purest water sparkled in
her ears, gleamed upon her bosom, and an exquisite
crescent was fastened among the glossy coils of her
still rich and abundant hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never had she been more beautiful, even in her
youth, than now, as she stood upon the threshold of
her new home, where she was destined to reign for
long years yet, an honored and idolized wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Happiness had done much for her during the last
few weeks; her face had resumed its rounded outlines;
a delicate bloom had come into her cheeks; her
lips were like lines of brightest coral; her eyes brilliant
with the exhilaration caused by the restoration
of blissful hopes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just behind her, and now attended by Rupert Hamilton,
was Virgie, inexpressibly lovely in cream-white
silk, with no ornaments save a bunch of fragrant
mignonette in her corsage; but, in the eyes of her
lover, and to others gathered there, she seemed the
fairest vision of youth that they had ever looked upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton afterward confessed that she suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>more than death in the brief interval that elapsed before
her brother led his bride cross the threshold and
advanced to greet her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she was a woman of indomitable will, and,
though her spirit for a moment recoiled beneath this
unexpected blow, she resolutely rallied her failing
courage—an almost uncontrollable rage took possession
of her as she realized how she had been duped—fooled;
how this overwhelming surprise had been
deliberately prepared for her, and, though she was as
colorless as the costly lace that was fluttering upon
her bosom with every pulsation of her fiercely bounding
heart, she swept haughtily toward that regal-looking
couple until within a few feet of them, when
she made a profound obeisance before them, saying
with formal politeness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welcome, Sir William and Lady Heath, to Heathdale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She met and bore her defeat superbly, although she
was sick at heart and almost in a frenzy of anger,
mortification, and humiliation, at being thus triumphantly
confronted in her own home by the woman,
whom, all her life, she had schemed to crush. To think
that she should have made all these elaborate preparations
and planned this brilliant welcome but to suffer
such an ignominious overthrow in Virginia Alexander’s
very presence, was maddening beyond description.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she would rather have died than betray anything
of the conflict within her, and, after that one
obeisance, she stepped aside to allow others to offer
their greetings and congratulations, and by the time
supper was announced she had recovered, to all outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>appearances at least, entire control of herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William led the way to the dining-room, and,
without one word to his sister, conducted his wife to
the head of the table, whispering fondly as he seated
her:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welcome, my darling, to your home and to your
position as mistress of Heathdale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then sought his own place opposite, while the
butler seated the other guests according to their
rank.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two others among that company who
had recognized the new mistress of Heathdale with
fear and trembling—Mrs. Farnum and her daughter,
Lady Royalston.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, judging from Lady Heath’s gracious manner
and the attention which she bestowed upon all her
guests alike, there was not one among the company
whom she did not regard in the most friendly way.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was simply charming; her bearing and all her
observances of etiquette were faultless, and once, during
the meal, Lady Royalston bent and whispered in
her mother’s ear:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the woman whom Lady Linton scorned
as unfit to mate with a Heath! This is the woman
whom we lent our aid to ruin! Mamma, we ought to
go down on our knees to her and her lovely daughter
whom we have so wronged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Heaven’s sake, Sadie, do not add to my torture,”
returned Mrs. Farnum, with pale lips. “Remember
it was all for you—I knew that you loved——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do, mamma; we will never open that
grave again,” returned Lady Royalston, losing some
of her own color, “but I would give much to be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to have Lady Heath for my friend, and I am impressed
that we shall never be bidden to Heathdale again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner, an hour or more was spent in social
intercourse, during which something of Sir William’s
and Lady Heath’s story was divulged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baronet had insisted upon this, for Virgie’s
sake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is my own daughter, and I must claim her as
such before the whole world,” he said, so as much
as he deemed advisable to relate, without publicly
compromising any one who had been instrumental in
causing the misunderstanding between himself and
his wife, he told to his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also announced at the same time that Mr.
Hamilton, the baronet’s ward, had won the baronet’s
beautiful daughter, and that there would be another
wedding about Easter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Lady Linton heard this she looked around
for Lillian, but she had quietly withdrawn from the
company directly after dinner, and did not make her
appearance again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening was over at last, and the guests dispersed,
pronouncing Lady Heath “delightful,” and
predicting a happy future for the master of Heathdale
after the romantic trials of his youth and the
sorrow of his later years.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mrs. Farnum and her daughter took leave
of Sir William and his bride, the baronet simply bowed
to them without offering his hand, saying, with the
least possible but unmistakable emphasis:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, Mrs. Farnum; adieu, Lady Royalston.”
And both knew that all the past had been explained,
and they had received their final <i><span lang="fr">congé</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Lady Royalston’s prediction had been verified.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the last guest had departed, Sir William
turned to his sister, his face stern and cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miriam,” he said, in a tone that made her shiver,
“at last I have found my Virgie, my mountain maid
whom I have loved all my life long. But what of the
lost years of the past?—the sorrow, the loneliness, and
misunderstanding? What of the hatred and treachery
that produced it all?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Every word fell upon Lady Linton’s heart as if it
had been a blow from a hammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made a gesture of despair. She could not speak;
she felt that she should go mad unless she could soon
get away to the quiet of her room and be released
from that fearful constraint which she had imposed
upon herself for so many hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Heath read something of her suffering in that
wild gesture, and she laid her lips against her husband’s
ear, whispering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Will, we can afford to be generous out of the
abundance of our happiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William’s face melted into infinite tenderness at
her plea.</p>

<p class='c007'>He placed his arm about her waist and drew her
fondly to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you can plead for her, my darling, I should not
be obdurate,” he murmured, tenderly; then, turning
again to his sister, he added: “We will talk further of
this matter to-morrow. Good-night, Miriam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With one more stern glance at the unhappy woman,
he led his beautiful wife from the room, and Lady
Linton, her strength exhausted, her proud spirit
crushed, sank with a moan of anguish to the floor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>there the butler found her half an hour later when
he came to put out the lights.</p>

<p class='c007'>He called her maid, and together they helped her to
her room, where she spent half the night in hysterics,
and then, worn out, sank into a profound slumber or
stupor.</p>

  <h2 id='XXII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>A BACKWARD GLANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In order to more fully comprehend the events related
in the last chapter we must go back to the day
following Lady Dunforth’s reception, when Mrs. Alexander’s
lawyer, Mr. Thurston, called and held a protracted
interview with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had consulted him soon after arriving in London,
and, after gathering all the information possible
regarding her history, he informed her that there
would be no difficulty whatever in establishing Virgie’s
claim, as a daughter of the House of Heath, and
this morning he had called to tell her that he was ready
to arrange a meeting with Sir William whenever she
felt equal to the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Must I meet him!” she asked, growing faint at the
thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be best for both you and Miss Alexander
to meet him at the outset, for, of course, if he is at
all inclined to contest the claim, he will at once demand
the proof of your identity,” Mr. Thurston replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander felt that this would be a severer
test upon her strength than she had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not wish to meet Sir William, and yet at the
same time there was an almost uncontrollable longing
in her heart to see him once more. If she could look
upon him without his seeing her, it would be all she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>would ask; she shrank from forcing herself upon his
presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still if it must be, she resolved to brace herself for
the interview; she had determined that he should
acknowledge Virgie as his child, and nothing should
deter her from accomplishing her object.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” she said, “I will be governed wholly
by your advice. But what is this?” she added, as he
laid a paper before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I simply desire your signature to this document
as a mere matter of form,” the lawyer told her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander signed it and passed it back to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virginia N. Alexander,” he read; then he started.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your middle name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Norton. My grandmother was an English woman,
by that name, before her marriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was her Christian name?” Mr. Thurston
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nora.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whom did she marry?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A man by the name of Charles Bradford. They
went to America soon after their marriage and settled
in California,” Mrs. Alexander replied, wondering why
the lawyer should question her thus regarding her
family.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did your grandmother have any brothers or sisters?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe there was a brother—Albert by name—for
I have heard my mother, who was called Alberta, say
that she was named for an uncle; but I never knew
anything of him, as he lived in England, and, after
my grandmother’s death, all communication between
the families ceased. It was a whim of hers to call me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Virginia Norton, for she said she did not wish the
family name to die out entirely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Thurston changed color and began to look excited.
He drew a set of tablets from his pocket, and,
opening them, examined several entries therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Alexander,” he said at last, “I believe you
have at last unwittingly solved a riddle that has been
a very complicated one to me and my partner for
the last two years, and which we had almost despaired
of ever solving.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can that be?” she asked, greatly surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen, and I will tell you,” said the lawyer.
“There is living in Cheshire County, England, a man
by the name of Lord Albert Norton——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do not think there was ever any title in our
family,” Mrs. Alexander interrupted, smiling. “I am
sure they were people in moderate circumstances, as
my grandfather went to America to try to improve
his condition in life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Albert Norton was a comparatively poor man
himself until he was over fifty years of age,” Mr.
Thurston went on, composedly, “when he published
some literary works of great merit. He began about
that time to interest himself in political affairs, and
was created a peer of the realm in 1840. He has been a
very eccentric man, has never married, but devoted
himself almost wholly to literature and politics. He
has amassed wealth rapidly during the later years of
his life, for, having no one but himself on whom
to expend it, his income has accumulated. He seldom
went into society and rarely entertained in his own
home. He is now about ninety years of age, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>although very feeble in body, his mind appears to be
as vigorous as ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two years ago he applied to us to look up some
relatives who went to America many years ago. We
were authorized to make thorough work and spare no
expense, for his lordship was anxious that his property
should go to some of his kindred rather than to
the crown after his death. We traced Nora Norton
Bradford to California, but she had been dead many
years. We found she had had a daughter Alberta
who had married a man by the name of Alexander.
She and her husband were also dead; their graves
were found in the Lone Mountain cemetery, San
Francisco. We learned that they, too, had a daughter
by the name of Virginia, but she had disappeared from
the city several years ago, and no trace of her could
be found; not until I saw your signature this morning
did it occur to me that I had found the heir for whom
Lord Norton commissioned us to search so long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alexander looked up with a pale, wondering
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to imply that I am Lord Norton’s
heir?” she asked, in an agitated tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly,” replied Mr. Thurston, confidently, “judging
from what you have told me there can be no doubt
of it. I suppose that you have proofs of your identity,
however?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I have my marriage certificate and an old
Bible that belonged to my grandmother, which contains,
in her own handwriting, the date of her birth
and marriage, also that of her husband’s death and
my mother’s birth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be ample proof. And now, Mrs. Alexander,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>as Lord Norton is in a very critical condition,
being liable to drop away any day, we must go to
Chester immediately. When can you be ready?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In an hour, if necessary,” she replied, “but it does
not seem possible that I can be related to this gentleman!
I cannot realize it—a peer of the realm!” she
quoted to herself with a strange smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will submit our evidence to his lordship himself
and see what his verdict will be,” returned Mr.
Thurston, smiling. “A train will leave for Liverpool
at two this afternoon. Chester is a few miles this side,
and we will avail ourselves of that, if agreeable to
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; I submit myself wholly to your guidance,
in this matter,” Mrs. Alexander responded.
“Meantime, I suppose, my other business will have to
wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should advise it; as Lord Norton is in such a critical
condition, every moment is precious. It will be
far better for him to recognize you as his heir, than to
be obliged to prove it after his death; and, madam,
you will occupy no mean position if you become the
mistress of Englewood, which is the name of his fine
estate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Thurston then took his leave, promising to call
in season to accompany her to the train, and then the
still wondering woman sought Virgie and related the
marvelous tale to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the business that called them so suddenly
from London, and which was destined to bring about
even greater changes in their lives before their return.</p>

<p class='c007'>They arrived at Englewood late in the evening, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>found his lordship’s carriage awaiting them at the station,
for Mr. Thurston had telegraphed of his coming, and
stated that he should bring two ladies with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found Englewood, at least what they were
able to see of it, a delightful place. The house, a
massive structure of stone, was an ancient affair, but
it had been well preserved, and although it was the
home of an eccentric old bachelor, was a most comfortable
and home-like dwelling. Evidently his lordship
knew and appreciated the luxuries of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following morning, Mr. Thurston had an interview
with the invalid and informed him of his recent
discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Norton expressed himself very much delighted
with the news, and appeared very eager to make the
acquaintance of his grand-niece and her daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, after he was somewhat rested, Mr.
Thurston conducted the ladies into his presence, and
the moment his eye rested upon Mrs. Alexander, he
declared his conviction that she was a Norton; “her
features are very like his sister Nora’s,” he said, “although
her grandmother was not nearly as handsome,”
he added, with a twinkle of humor about his mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Bible and marriage certificate were brought
to him, and confirmed his statement regarding the
relationship. He recognized his sister’s handwriting
immediately, and produced some of her letters to compare
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There can be no doubt,” Mr. Thurston said, after
a careful examination of the chirography, “and I congratulate
you, my lord, upon the fulfillment of your
desire; and you, madam,” turning to his client, “upon
having discovered your relative.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Will you stay with me, Virginia?” the old man
asked, turning a wistful glance upon the beautiful
woman. “It will not be for long,” he added; “the
sands of my life are nearly run out; a few days, or
weeks at the most, will end my life, and it will be
pleasant to feel that some of my own kin are near me
at the last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, his niece said, she would stay; her heart went
out with a feeling of pity and tenderness toward the
man, who all his life, had lived in such loneliness and
isolation, and she resolved that she would devote herself
exclusively to his comfort during the little while
that he remained upon earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Thurston was detained a day or two to attend
to some business, relating to the will, which gave
everything, with the exception of some annuities to
old servants, to Virginia Alexander and her heirs
forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had come to Englewood on the very day of
Mr. William Heath’s accident, and it was the following
morning, at the very hour of her first interview
with her uncle, that Sir William Heath received the
telegram announcing his cousin’s critical condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>He, too, left on the two o’clock train for Liverpool,
reaching Middlewich about the same time that Mrs.
Alexander had arrived at Englewood the night before.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was three days later, that in accordance with his
proposition to the Duke of Falmouth to act as amanuensis
to Lord Norton in his cousin’s place, he went
to Englewood to begin his work under the old lord’s
direction, little dreaming of the surprise and joy in
store for him there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>When the butler answered his ring, he stated his
business, and was shown directly to the invalid’s
chamber, where he found him propped up in bed with
manuscripts lying all about him, and impatiently
awaiting his appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spent several hours, learning the plan of the
work, making notes, and even venturing a few suggestions
upon some points regarding which he was
well posted, and then took his leave promising to get
regularly to work the next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he was following the servant down stairs, the
man remarked that his carriage was not ready, but if
he would step into the library for a few moments, he
would inform him when it came to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>He signified his willingness to do so and passed
down the wide old hall, which was paneled in oak
exquisitively carved, to a lofty room, furnished and
frescoed in rich tints, and lined from floor to ceiling
with books of every description.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a most luxurious apartment, and plainly indicated
that the old lord, eccentric though he might be
on some points, had loved the elegancies of life. If he
had been something of a miser, as report accredited
him, it could not have been in anything relating to
his own comfort or tastes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William sat down by a table that was drawn
close to a cheerful fire, and, leaning back lazily in the
huge lounging chair stationed there, he took up the
morning paper which lay open at his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had read scarcely a dozen lines, when the door
behind him opened and some one came forward, saying,
in an eager tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Virgie, I have just found an old Bible up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>stairs, in which there are records of all family births,
marriages, and deaths for many generations; my
grandmother’s and my mother’s are among them and
correspond exactly with those I have—ah! excuse me;
sir—I thought—oh, Heaven!”——</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h2 id='XXIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='large'>REUNITED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Virginia Alexander had gone up to her room less
than half an hour previous, leaving Virgie in the
library reading, and snugly ensconced in that great
lounging chair by the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>While looking for something in a closet, she had
come across the old Bible referred to, and opening it
for examination, she had found a complete genealogical
record covering more than a century and a half.</p>

<p class='c007'>Delighted with her discovery, she hastened back to
Virgie—who meantime had stolen out for a little exercise—eager
to tell her news, and, coming into the
room turning the leaves of the book, she had not
noticed that a stranger was there until Sir William
suddenly arose, his heart bounding within him at the
sound of that well-remembered voice, and turned
toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not seen him for more than eighteen years,
and he had changed far more than she during that
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sorrow had saddened him somewhat; he had grown
grave and dignified, and his hair had just begun to
be streaked with silver. There were lines about his
mouth telling of a grief that he had never outgrown,
there was a wistful look in his eyes showing that his
heart still yearned for the love of his youth. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>form, too, had developed; he was broader-shouldered
and stouter.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was a grand and kingly looking man, and she
knew him in a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The color left her face; something seemed to smite
her heart with a heavy blow, almost benumbing her,
and she put out her hand, catching at the table for support,
while the Bible fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she was very lovely even in her pallor and consternation.
She wore a tea-gown of silver-gray, with
a dainty fichu of lace and blue ribbons, while, as she
arose from the dinner-table an hour before, Virgie had
selected some pink and white roses and playfully
tucked them in her corsage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even during that first blissful year of their wedded
life she had never seemed more beautiful or more dear
to Sir William Heath than at that moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie,” he cried, springing toward her, and would
have caught her wildly to his breast, the past all forgotten,
conscious only that he had found her, his own
loved one, once more!</p>

<p class='c007'>But she rallied instantly, though she trembled violently
and still clung to the table for support.</p>

<p class='c007'>She put out her hand to stop him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir William Heath!” she said, weakly, but with a
haughty bearing which became her well, and warned
him that he must not approach her, causing him to
remember, too, that she was his wife no longer, for
that dread decree of the divorce court stood between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet he loved her madly still; his heart recognized
her as his wife in spite of all.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Oh, Virgie, I have found you at last!” he cried, his
voice breaking in a great sob.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last we meet,” she said, with pale lips, although
she thrilled at his words, “but I did not think it would
be like this. Did you come here to seek me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I came upon business with Lord Norton. I
never dreamed of finding you here. Where have you
been all these long—these endless years? Where is
our child? Oh, Virgieseamstresses how can you stand there like
that, so cold, so relentless, when you think of that bond
between us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—there is between us a barrier as relentless, as
impassable as death!” she murmured, with quivering
lips, while a film seemed gathering over her eyes, and
her strength almost failed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something in her tone and manner told Sir William,
that she still loved him in spite of the misunderstanding
of the past, and her present coldness, and his heart
leaped with a sweet, new hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie, there is no barrier—there has never been
any barrier save that which you yourself have interposed
between us,” he said, eagerly, and venturing a
step nearer to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she put out her hand to check him—that
small, beautiful hand whose rosy finger-tips he had
so loved to kiss in those old days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your wife! your son!” she murmured, brokenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no wife, Heaven help me!” he cried, the
veins standing out full and hard upon his forehead.
“What can you mean? I have no son.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are they—dead?” she asked, lifting her eyes to his
face for the first time since he had first confronted her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he returned, briefly, trying to comprehend her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>meaning, for of course he never knew that she had
seen his cousin’s boy and believed him his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?” Virgie questioned, catching her breath
quickly. Was it possible that the beautiful woman
he had married had, after long years, discovered his
treachery and forsaken him?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie, my beloved, I never had but one wife,”
said Sir William, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>She seemed turning to stone at those words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had there been some terrible mistake after all? Had
she lost eighteen years of happiness when she might
have been his loved and loving wife?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” he went on, eagerly, “all about that
wretched blunder in the newspapers, when my cousin,
William Heath, was mistaken for me. He was married
to Miss Margaret Stanhope soon after my return
to England, but the notice in the papers read as if I
had been married instead. They have a son. Oh,
Virgie! is it possible that you have believed Willie
was my boy?” he asked, light beginning to break in
upon his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moan of pain broke from the pale woman before
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they told me, Lady Linton wrote; ah! those
cruel letters,” she faltered, in a voice of anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who told you? what has my sister——” Sir William
began, but that brave, long suffering heart, could
bear no more as it realized all too late, that the bitter
past need not have been, and she sank unconscious
at his feet before he could complete his sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William sprang forward with a cry of fear, and
raised her tenderly in his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>He laid her bright head upon his breast; he bent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>kissed the fair, pale face with passionate, trembling
lips, and held her to his throbbing heart with a clasp
that claimed her all his own, in spite of the cruel decree
that had parted them for so many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Virgie did not lose herself for more than a moment;
the fall partially restored her, and she began to
realize what was passing even though she had not
strength to assert herself. She knew that she was
lying upon the bosom of the man whom she had
always loved, and it seemed like a blessed repose to
rest there, and to feel his sheltering arms around her
after the cares and struggles of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew now that he had always loved her, and had
been true to her, and that the woman, who for more
than eighteen years had been the object of her jealousy
and envy was, as far as he was concerned, but a
myth—a phantom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh! the delight of knowing that his affection had
never wavered, of realizing that he had been as faithful
to her as she to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes unclosed and she looked up into the fond
face bending over her, and a quick flush of happiness
swept up to her brow, as she met the fervent lovelight
in his glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat up and gently released herself from his
clinging arms, and he raised and led her to the great
chair in which he had been sitting when she entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment there came a knock on the door
and the servant announced that Sir William’s carriage
was ready.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William controlled his emotion as well as he was
able, and turning to the man, said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“I find I cannot leave for another hour yet, please
send the carriage back to the stable, and I will ring
when I wish it again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man bowed and withdrew, and Sir William
turned again to his dear one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you better, Virgie! Shall I call a maid to get
you something?” he asked, regarding her still pale face
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, do not,” she pleaded, putting out her hand
beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At least let me get you some water,” he said, and
going to a table where there were an ice pitcher and
goblets, he filled a glass, and brought it to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She drank thirstily and passed the goblet back to
him, looking up with a grateful little smile for the
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent impulsively and touched his lips to her forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling!” he breathed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the quick color flooded her face and tears
sprang into her eyes; how she had longed for years to
hear those tender tones!</p>

<p class='c007'>The sight of her tears moved him deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>He put down the glass, and kneeling beside her
drew her again into his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my love!” he whispered, a great sob heaving
his broad chest, “you have been cruelly deceived, but
set me at rest upon one point—tell me that you love
me yet. I have never been untrue to you in thought
or deed. I have lived a lonely, solitary life. I have
been heart-broken without you. Virgie, you were the
one love of my whole life; now tell me if your heart
is still mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>She bowed her head upon his breast, melted by his
fond words, and sobbed in an agony of grief for her
lost happiness; she twined her arms about his neck
and drew his face down to her tear-wet cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Will,” she murmured, brokenly, “I have ruined
all your life and mine! I should have come to you, in
spite of all, and to learn my fate from your own lips.
We have lost all these years when we might have been
so happy. You know that I love you; every day, every
hour of my life my heart has cried out for you. I
have literally been starving for your love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He needed no stronger proof of her devotion; he
knew that she loved him as fondly now as in those
months of their early wedded life, and he folded her
still closer to him, kissing, again and again, those dear
lips, which for eighteen years had known no caress
save what she had received from her child.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their reunion was perfect and complete, and, for a
little while, they could think of nothing, speak of
nothing save the joy of being once more all in all to
each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at length Sir William insisted that she should
tell him all the story of the past; how the first suspicion
of his treachery had taken root in her mind, and all the
circumstances attending her quitting the hotel in New
York where he had left her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was amazed when she related Mrs. Farnum’s instrumentality
in the matter. It had never occurred
to him that she could have been connected with it,
although he had known that she was in America at
that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was furious upon learning how she had garbled
the account of his cousin’s engagement to Margaret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Stanhope, and how his sister had purposely misrepresented
facts in order to accomplish their separation.</p>

<p class='c007'>He understood at once the whole plot, and recalled
many things which went to prove that her ambition
for him and her unreasonable prejudice against Virgie
had been at the root of the whole matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did she dare write such falsehoods?” he cried, as
Virgie repeated some passages from her letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she replied, “I copied both letters. I knew
that some time there would come a day of reckoning
between you and me, and although every line had
been burned into my brain, as if branded there with
a hot iron, I was resolved that you should have all
the evidence against you, and know whence my information
came.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you those copies with you, darling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; they are in my trunk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you go and get them for me? I want them
now,” he said, with a pale, set face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie left the room to comply with his request, but
returned almost immediately with an envelope and a
package in her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are the letters—both are inclosed in one envelope,”
she said, “and this is something that belongs
to your sister, Lady Linton,” and she handed both
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She then told him how strangely her uncle had become
possessed of that package so many years ago,
and how she had but recently discovered to whom it
belonged. She desired that he would now take charge
of it and return it to her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be something very important for Miriam
to be unwilling to trust it in the house during her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>absence,” Sir William remarked, as he examined the
seal and read the sentence penned upon the wrapper.</p>

<p class='c007'>He laid it carelessly upon his knee, while he drew
the copies of those miserable letters from their envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in so doing he changed his position slightly
and the package, which a moment before he had laid
down, tumbled to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It struck on a corner and the wrapper, which was old
and brittle, burst from end to end, revealing a book
about six inches long by four wide, which flew open
midway as it escaped confinement disclosing pages
closely written in Lady Linton’s own hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! a diary, I judge,” said Sir William, as he
stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he gave a violent start as a few words caught
his eye, and every atom of color fled from his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton wrote a very bold, almost masculine
hand, and it would hardly have been possible for anyone
to be so near the book and not catch something
written there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words which the baronet saw were under the
date of August 15, and read thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another letter from that girl in New York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lifted his glance for an instant to Virgie—hesitated,
then resolutely bent his eyes again upon the page
and read on, while Virgie wondered at the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>“* * * * Will she never have done sending her whining,
nauseating love-missives to W?” said the diary.
“My patience is exhausted watching the mail bag, lest
by some chance he should get one, and all my nicely
laid schemes be upset just as success seems so
sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>He turned a few leaves, glancing with lightning-like
rapidity over them until he came to another entry that
arrested his attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plot has worked to a charm, Myra says she
accepted the whole story for a fact, and believes W.
really untrue to her. She claims though that the child
is legitimate, and says she will yet prove it. She
threatens divorce—not wishing to hold a man unwillingly
bound, ha! ha! If she will only carry out that
project, my heart will be at rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still further on he read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The girl has gone—disappeared, and no one knows
whither. Her last letter was really quite tragic, but,
thank fortune, it was the last; she said it was a final
plea, but the paper writhed and seemed almost like a
thing of life as I burned it; it nearly gave me the
horrors. But I can afford to suffer a few stings for the
sake of keeping that low-born girl from disgracing
the house of Heath. W. will get over his moping by
and by, and marry again befitting his rank; but if he
does not, why, Percy and Lillian will be the gainers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The book dropped from Sir William’s nerveless
fingers at this point, for a terrible passion was raging
within him as the heartlessness, the treachery and
cunning of his sister were revealed. He understood
everything now; he realized how his sister had
schemed and plotted the ruin of all his hopes, out of
spite against the innocent girl whom he had married,
and in the hope that he would choose a wife from the
English aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely Mark Alexander’s prophecy had come true,
for that mysterious package had indeed proved useful
to Virgie in this crisis of her life. Sir William was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>amazed, shocked, and moved to fearful anger at his
sister’s daring wickedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had robbed his mail bag for months, intercepting
both his own and his wife’s letters. She had also
been guilty of falsehood and treachery of the worst
kind, hardening her heart against his sufferings, ignoring
the agony of a beautiful young wife and mother,
and all the while eating his bread, educating her children
at his expense, and lavishly spending his money
to gratify her own extravagant tastes and whims.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will, dear, you positively frighten me! What troubles
you? Your face is terrible to look upon,” Virgie
said, laying her hand gently upon his arm to arouse
him from the stern reverie into which he had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started at her touch, took the fair hand and
raised it lovingly to his lips, while a smile, that was
like sunlight after a tempest, broke over his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I was in a terrible mood, my darling,”
he said, “but you will not marvel when I tell you all
that I have read; no, I will not tell you,” he added,
“it would be cruel to make you live over the past again
as you would if I should reveal all my sister’s treachery
to you. Suffice it to say that all our sorrow has
been the result of a cunningly devised and—yes, a
fiendish plot that originated in her brain. Under ordinary
circumstances I should regard a diary as something
sacred to its owner, but the few words that
caught my eye as I picked the book up made me feel
justified in reading more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Virgie,” Sir William concluded, sternly, “I
shall never forgive Miriam Linton for the ruin which
she wrought eighteen years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he read the letters, and his ire grew hotter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and fiercer until he came to that portion where lady
Linton sent the money to Virgie and advised her to
“go away to some quiet place, where she was not
known, and might be able to bring up her child in a
respectable way, so that its future might not be hampered
by its mother’s mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point, his anger reached a white heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William dashed the paper to the floor, his face
one crimson sheet of flame, and pressed to his breast
the woman he so passionately loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor, wronged darling, how dared she write
such horrible things of you?” he cried, in a shaking
voice, “and to send you that paltry hundred pounds!
What must you have thought of me, to be guilty of
such a dastardly act, after taking away all the fortune
that your father settled upon you? I wonder your love
did not all turn to bitterest hatred. Oh, Virgie! Virgie!
I feel as if I could not bear it, even though you
are all my own once more,” he concluded, great drops
of agony starting out upon his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t, Will,” she whispered, clinging fondly to him,
“it is all over now; let us forget it, if possible, and
enjoy to the utmost our new-found happiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forget! I can never forget. I will never forgive
this terrible wrong,” he said sternly. “Oh, my love,
nothing can give us back those lost years; nothing can
ever make me forget that for more than eighteen years
I had a lovely daughter and never once looked upon
her face to know her as such. Miriam Linton is a
sister of mine no longer.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h2 id='XXIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='large'>“GOD IS GOOD.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“To think,” continued Sir William, after a moment
of thought, “how systematically she set about her
dreadful work, how remorselessly she persisted in it
until she had achieved her end. And Mrs. Farnum!
how she could see and know you, my beloved; how she
could look upon that innocent darling, in whom was
centered the hopes of both of us, and lend her aid,
is a marvel and—a shame upon the name of woman!
She shall never cross the threshold of Heathdale
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot understand how she could have lent herself
to such a base intrigue!” said Virgie, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William smiled bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, dear?” she asked, remarking it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I can give a reason, although it may
sound somewhat egotistical,” he returned. “Sadie Farnum—now
Lady Royalston—once aspired to become
Lady Heath, while it was the dearest wish of both
her mother and my sister, who have been life-long
friends, that I should marry her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie flushed. She could now understand why she
had been the object of their curious glances when they
first came to the —— Hotel, New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William leaned forward and touched his lips to
her crimson cheek and murmured:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“But I never saw but one woman whom I could
be willing to have reign as mistress in my home.
Virgie, I shall take you to Heathdale immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her whole face was dyed scarlet in an instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You forget,” she faltered, humbly, “I have no right
to go there. I have forfeited all title to your name
and home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did forget,” he answered, growing pale and sighing
heavily. “I cannot realize since I have found you
but that you belong to me now as in those early days;
and you do; before Heaven, you are as truly my wife
to-day as you ever were. But,” and his arm closed
tenderly about her, “the only obstacle is a legal point,
and that is easily removed. You wish it, do you not,
my darling? You will come to me at once?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should die if I lost you again,” Virgie cried, clinging
to him with another burst of tears. “It has been a
weary struggle to live without you all these years.
But for Virgie I would gladly have laid down the burden
long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then may I go to London immediately for a special
license, since we must conform to the letter of the law?
I can never be separated from you again,” said Sir
William, as he fondly wiped her falling tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how can I leave my uncle, Lord Norton?” Virgie
asked, suddenly remembering that new claim upon
her and her promise not to leave him while he lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Norton your uncle? Ah, that accounts for
your being here. I could not understand it,” returned
the baronet, looking astonished and remembering for
the first time where she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie explained how the relationship had recently
been discovered, and informed him of his lordship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>wishes that she should remain with him for the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must respect the wishes of a dying man,” Sir
William gravely replied, “and I, too, had forgotten my
own obligations to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He told her all the circumstances of his cousin’s
accident and the summons that had brought him
thither; of his proposal to try and complete the manuscript
of Lord Norton’s book, as, of course, Mr. William
Heath would not be able to resume his work for
a long time, and his lordship was liable to pass away
without having his heart’s desire accomplished if he
attempted to wait for his recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it was finally agreed between them that they
would wait at least until the completion of the manuscript
before taking any steps for their reunion. They
would see much of each other every day, while Sir
William thought it would not be liable to create quite
so much excitement in society if it was announced
beforehand that he was soon to marry the niece of
Lord Norton.</p>

<p class='c007'>He declared, however, that his sister should know
nothing beyond that fact until their return to Heathdale;
but Virgie was so happy in being reunited to
the love of her youth that she was almost willing to
overlook and forgive Lady Linton’s instrumentality
in her previous suffering, and even to invite her and
her family to be present when their new ties should
be solemnized.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Sir William was inexorable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he said, sternly; “it shall come upon her like
a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. She has always
wanted me to marry, and doubtless she will be jubilant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>when I announce my intentions; then she will
imagine her triumph over you complete, and she shall
not be undeceived until she sees you enter our future
home as its mistress, for, of course, she will never
dream that you and Lord Norton’s niece are one and
the same person; hers will be a double punishment
when we all get home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Double! how so?” Virgie asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has long been her desire to marry Lillian to Rupert,
my ward; but it seems, my darling, that he has
chosen our daughter to be his wife. How strange it all
seems,” he concluded, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you learn so much?” Virgie inquired,
with some surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The young gentleman himself came and told me a
couple of days ago; he said he considered it his duty
to inform me; but, let me tell you, my sister’s disappointment
will be no light one when she learns the
fact,” Sir William answered, all unsuspicious that her
ladyship had learned the secret at the same time that
he was informed of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does Lillian care for him?” Virgie asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid she does,” was the sober response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor child,” sighed Virgie, regretfully, “and I am
really sorry for Lady Linton’s disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you so readily forgive my sister, Virgie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I can, Will; I truly desire the spirit of
forgiveness even for the great wrong that she has
been guilty of; and, since nothing can ever again mar
our trust in each other, I do not wish to cherish bitterness
toward anyone. I am truly grieved for Lillian;
she is not accountable for her mother’s faults,
and I have suffered too much, in believing another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>had usurped my place in your heart, not to feel a
deep sympathy for her in losing Rupert.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William sighed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He regretted Lillian’s unhappiness too, for he was
very fond of her. She was a bright, beautiful girl,
and for years had been the light of his home; and
he believed, away from her mother’s influence, she
would make a noble woman. Still it was a matter
for rejoicing with him that the young man whom
he loved as a son would soon become a son indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie’s meeting with her father was quite touching.
Her mother had never told her who he was. She had
shrunk more and more from the ordeal as the time
drew near when it must be revealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had intended telling her the morning following
Lady Dunforth’s reception when she had so unexpectedly
learned that Sir William was Rupert’s
guardian, and she would have done so but for Mr.
Thurston’s visit, his startling revelation of her relationship
to Lord Norton, and their sudden departure
from London.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was glad now that she had delayed the communication,
for when she now made it, she could
soften the otherwise shocking intelligence by telling
her that all the past had been but a cruel mistake,
which at last had been explained and rectified—that
her father was a true and noble man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie came in from her walk just as her father
and mother were speaking of Lillian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There comes Virgie,” said her mother, starting
up. “I must go to prepare her for her meeting with
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“How much does she know?” Sir William asked,
paling a trifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Will, she does not yet even know her own
name, nor who her father is. I <em>could</em> not tell her,
although I had promised to do so soon,” Virgie explained,
with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baronet bent and touched them softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad, my beloved, that you have not told
her; the shock will not be so severe now. Go, dear,
but send her to me as quickly as possible, for my
heart yearns for her. I know now why her presence
affected me so strangely the other evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He released her, and she glided from the room to
meet her daughter just outside the door; another moment
and she would have entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, what is it?” the young girl exclaimed, as
she read in her expressive face something of the great
change that had come to her during the last hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with me, dear; I have something to tell you,”
her mother said, and she slipped her arm about her
waist and drew her into a small room opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>In as few words as possible she told her all that
had occurred, and the name of her father—the name
which she had so long withheld from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir William Heath, Rupert’s guardian, <em>my father</em>!”
said the bewildered girl, looking utterly dazed by the
startling information.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, darling. It is a romance in real life, is it
not?—and one which will end more happily than such
romances usually do,” was the smiling reply, although
there were tears upon the grateful woman’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That accounts for a great deal,” said Virgie, musingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Such as what, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your strange actions the other evening when Rupert
told you who his guardian was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I utterly lost my self-possession then. It
was an unlooked-for shock, and I feared that matters
were going to be terribly mixed when you came to
marry Rupert. But, darling, we must not keep your
father waiting; he is longing for you. Remember, he
has never yet looked upon the face of his own child,
to recognize her as such.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, mamma,” Virgie began, a startling thought
coming to her, “you are—you are not——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she faltered and stopped, her face covered with
confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am, and I am not,’ is rather an ambiguous statement,
is it not, dear?” was the arch retort, although
her mother was also flushed as she caught her meaning.
“I understand your trouble, dear,” she added,
more gravely, “and everything is to be set right in a
little while. This reunion will soon be properly solemnized,
and then we shall all go home together.
Now go, and I will follow you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She led the beautiful girl to the door, kissed her
tenderly, and sent her to Sir William. Then she sped
swiftly up to her own room, where, locking herself in,
she fell upon her knees and sobbed out her grateful
thanks for the great joy that had been sent to her
that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie, her heart all aglow with love and happiness,
went straight to the library.</p>

<p class='c007'>Softly opening the door, she put her flushed, beautiful
face within, saying, with charming eagerness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma says that—that my father is here.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Sir William turned at the sound of that sweet voice,
his whole soul in his face, and held out his arms to
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virgie! my child!” he cried, in a tone that thrilled
her, and her heart instantly owned its kindred, without
a doubt of fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sprang to his breast, laughing and sobbing all
at once, and his kisses were rained upon her upturned
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my baby, whom I never saw! my darling for
whom my heart has yearned so many years! God is
good to give both my treasures to me, so fair and loving,”
he murmured, fondly, while his own tears mingled
with hers, and his chest heaved with the emotion
he could not control.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa!” Virgie breathed, with a tender inflection
that touched him deeply; “to think that I have
never been able to say it before, while I have
hardly dared to speak of you at all, because of the
suffering it caused mamma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How has she accounted for my absence, love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has always told me that you went over the
sea and were lost. Only since coming to London have
I learned that you were living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was better so,” the baronet murmured, with
a sigh. “It was better to have you think me dead,
than guilty of the unfaithfulness which she was led
to believe of me. But, my darling,” he added, holding
her off and gazing tenderly into her fair, young
face, “you are very like what your mother was when
I first saw her, and it is no wonder I was so attracted
toward you the other night at Lady Dunforth’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you?” Virgie asked, looking up eagerly; “it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>is very strange, but it almost seemed to me as if I had
known you in some previous state of existence! The
sound of your voice moved me deeply and I could
hardly restrain my tears when you gave me your hand
at parting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was the instinct of natural affection. Oh! it is
such delight to have found both my loved ones; and
yet,” he added, with a twinkle of his eyes, “I am
afraid I am not destined to have the exclusive right
to but one of them for very long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie blushed crimson and hid her face on her
father’s shoulder at this allusion to her engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>He raised it and kissed her softly on her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not be inconsolable,” he said, smiling, “for
if I have to resign something of my claim upon you, I
shall thereby secure a son whom I have always loved
as such. Rupert is a noble fellow, and he shall have
my heartiest blessing, also, when I give him my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie looked up archly at these words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that you and Rupert must have a mutual
admiration for each other,” she said, “for he is very
fond of extolling his guardian; and, papa, I believe—I
think you are very nice, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William laughed. It was very sweet to find
her so fond; he had feared that, never having known
what it was to have a father, she would be shy and
reserved at first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be mutual admiration between you and
me if you say such pleasant things,” he returned, with
another caress. “How much you are like your mother!—the
resemblance grows upon me constantly,” he
added, gazing closely into her lovely face, “all save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>your eyes; those, I think, are very like mine, my
pet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and mamma has always told me that they are
the dearest thing about me for that reason,” Virgie
answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William turned to gather his other Virgie into
his embrace—she having entered at that moment—a
happy smile on his lips at this fresh evidence of her
faithfulness to him.</p>

  <h2 id='XXV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'>THREADS GATHERED UP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lord Norton was at once informed of the romantic
incidents connected with his niece’s early life, and
while he sympathized with the trials and sorrow to
which she had been subjected, he also expressed his
gratification that all had ended so well, and she would
henceforth occupy so proud a position.</p>

<p class='c007'>He appeared to have conceived a great affection for
her during the little time she had been with him,
clinging to her as if she had been his own daughter,
while she devoted herself tirelessly to him, doing
everything in her power to make his last days peaceful
and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>He lived only three weeks after she went to Englewood,
but that was long enough to see the desire of
his heart accomplished; for Sir William worked diligently
upon his manuscript, completing it in about two
weeks, and thus the aged veteran had the satisfaction
of knowing that he would give to the world a valuable
historical work to perpetuate his name when the world
should know him no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The week following his death, and after the obsequies
were over, Sir William wrote that letter to
Lady Linton, announcing his contemplated marriage
with Lord Norton’s niece.</p>

<p class='c007'>He purposely withheld nearly everything from her,
save the bare facts that he was about to give Heathdale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>a mistress, and that she was the relative and
heiress of his lordship.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would have insisted upon having their reunion
solemnized immediately if his cousin, Mr. Heath, had
been considered wholly out of danger, while Virgie
pleaded that it would hardly be proper, following so
closely upon her uncle’s death.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went at once to Mrs. Heath upon being released
from her own duties in the sick-room, to express her
sympathy for her in her trouble, and the two women
instantly became the warmest friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Heath at once recognized Virgie as the beautiful
woman whom she had met several years previous
at Niagara. She was deeply wounded upon learning
how she had been deceived regarding her marriage,
and how she had suffered when they met, believing
her to be the wife of the man who had wooed and won
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I loved you even then,” she said, with starting
tears, “though I wondered why you appeared so
strangely at first. I wonder now how you were enabled
to conduct yourself with so much self-possession.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie and her playmate of that olden time renewed
their acquaintance with evident pleasure,
though the maiden could hardly realize that the stalwart,
but rather bashful young man, to whom she
was introduced as the “Willie” of long ago, was the
same with whom she had enjoyed such childish freedom
and shared her toys in the corridor of that great
hotel in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert was invited to come to Englewood the week
following the funeral of Lord Norton, when he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>greatly astonished to learn of the strange sequel to the
story of his guardian’s early life; and yet, a dim suspicion
of something of the kind had been floating in
his mind ever since that evening when Mrs. Alexander
had been so unnerved upon learning that Sir
William was his guardian; for he had known that there
had been some deep sorrow connected with his past,
and, having learned Mrs. Alexander’s story, it seemed
not unlikely that the two were in some way associated.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day that Virgie had encountered Lady Linton
in Oxford street she had come to London, Sir
William and Virgie accompanying her, to spend
several days, having found it necessary to make a
few purchases and some changes in her wardrobe before
going to Heathdale; so it will be readily understood
why the happy woman was at that time so unmoved
by her ladyship’s warnings and threats. Her
heart was too full of joy and gratitude to allow of her
feeling anything save pity and sorrow for her enemy,
for she knew but too well that her evil deeds would
all recoil upon her own head.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was fortunate for their plans, however, that her
ladyship did not meet her brother. He had accompanied
his beloved to the store, where, after fastening
that one lovely half-blown Lamarque rose in her mantle,
he took leave of her for awhile; and went to attend
to some business for himself; thus his presence
in the city was not even suspected by Lady Linton.
As soon as Virgie could be released by her dressmaker
they all returned once more to Englewood.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the 21st of the month Mr. William Heath was
so far advanced toward recovery that his physician
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>consented to allow him to be present at the ceremony,
which was to occur in the church at Chester, and afterward
to accompany the bridal party home to Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>At ten in the morning Sir William led the woman
of his deathless love once more to the altar. Virgie
and Rupert stood beside them as they renewed the
vows of their youth, while Mr. and Mrs. William
Heath, with their family, the Duke of Falmouth and
his household, were also present to witness the ceremony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rector had been told something of the history
of the couple upon whom he was to pronounce this
second nuptial benediction, and his words to them
were very solemn, very touching and impressive; and
then the reunited husband and wife went out from his
presence filled with a deep and holy joy such as they
had never hoped to realize again in this world, while
their future prospects seemed but the brighter for the
chastening they had endured.</p>

<p class='c007'>At noon the whole party left Englewood for Heathdale,
followed by the congratulations and good wishes
of the duke and his family, with whom Sir William
and Lady Heath had formed a delightful friendship,
and promised themselves much pleasure in the future
interchange of visits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William and his wife experienced a slight feeling
of dismay upon finding Heathdale all ablaze with
light, and a brilliant reception in progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had imagined that his sister, all unsuspicious
of whom he was to bring home, might be there to meet
him. He rather hoped she would, for he felt that Virgie
deserved the triumph of coming to take her position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>there in her presence; but he was not quite prepared
for a formal reception.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear that Miriam has killed the fatted calf, and
made a feast in view of our coming,” he said, as they
drove up the avenue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Will, it will be hardly the thing for me to
receive your friends in my traveling dress,” Virgie remarked,
in a dubious tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long will it take you to make a toilet?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Half an hour will be ample time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, then, while the rest of the party are
received at the main entrance, we will drive around
to a side door, slip up to our rooms, and send word
that we shall be happy to greet our friends at half-past
eight. Rupert, will you engineer the matter for
us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert gladly undertook the commission, and we
know with what success, as well as all that occurred
later, when Sir William appeared before the astonished
company with his wife, whom they had previously
known as Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the following day Lady Linton was so ill that
she was unable to leave her room. The shock she had
received, and the terrible restraint to which she had
afterward subjected herself, was too much for her
strength, and she was utterly exhausted, while her
proud spirit was crushed to the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian was also in a very unhappy state of mind,
although, to her credit be it said, she exerted herself,
for her uncle’s sake, to make everything as pleasant
for him and Lady Heath as she was able to do under
the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>She had spent the night in serious thought, and had
wisely resolved to make the best of what she could
not help, and in spite of the pain in her heart over her
disappointed hopes, she was won by the beauty and
sweetness of Rupert’s betrothed, and after a day or
two spent in each other’s society, it was safe to predict
that the two young girls would eventually become
firm friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the third day after his return Sir William visited
his sister in her own room, and had a long and serious
talk with her, deeming it wise to come to some understanding
regarding their future relations without further
delay.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew by the expression on his face, the moment
he entered her presence, that she had nothing to hope
from him; that he would not spare her for her part in
the vile plot which had caused the misery of his past
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a brief but very comprehensive statement
of the whole matter, charging her with all her treachery
and falsehood and crime, and she was forced to
acknowledge her guilt.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when he gave her the diary, portions of which
he had read, and she saw that it had been examined,
something of her old haughty spirit and arrogance
blazed forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Talk to me of falsehood; she told me that the seal
had never been broken,” she cried, with bitter scorn,
a spot of vivid scarlet settling upon each sallow cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And she told you nothing but the truth, Miriam,
for the seal was unbroken when she gave me the
package to return to you. My wife has never read a
single line that is written there. No one knows anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of its contents save you and me,” Sir William
replied, sternly, and then told her how he had happened
to discover the nature of its contents, after
which he felt justified in reading enough more to confirm
the suspicions that one line had aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have proved yourself a very unwomanly
woman, Miriam,” said her brother, with cold gravity.
“Your nature, aside from the affection which you have
for your children, is wholly selfish; it has become
warped—degraded. You have not only hardened yourself
against all honor and sisterly affection, but you
have committed the most reprehensible crimes to further
your miserable schemes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wrong you did my young wife years ago, the
insults you offered her, the falsehood and even theft
of which you were guilty in sending that hundred
pounds to her, the intercepting of our letters, are
things that I can never overlook.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you dare to accuse me of theft?” interrupted
Lady Linton, bridling. “You gave me that hundred
pounds for charitable purposes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I gave you that hundred pounds to use for the poor
girl who was injured in that railway accident, and you
stole it to add insult to injury. You mocked and
scorned a woman who was your superior in every
way—in whose veins there was as good blood as in
your own, notwithstanding your boasted preëminence,
and I grow cold with shame and horror every time I
think of that paltry sum that you sent her, when I
had brought back thousands of her money with me to
England. Mr. Alexander left a small fortune to his
daughter and I have had it in my possession ever
since.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Lady Linton looked up aghast at this information.
It was the first she had ever heard of that matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You begin to appreciate something of what I have
suffered,” he continued, as he noticed the look, “but
you can never begin to realize the misery which you
brought upon two loving hearts so long separated;
and to think that for more than eighteen years I was
a father and never once looked upon the face of my
child. Miriam, I can never overlook it. You have forfeited
all respect from me, all claim upon me, and
Heathdale can no longer be your home—you must
go elsewhere to live, for I will not subject my wife to
the constant companionship of one who has done her
such irreparable wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“William Heath, will you turn me out from my
home, where I was born?” cried the miserable woman,
almost fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your home?” he returned, severely. “For how
many years have you cheated my dear ones out of
<em>their</em> home—out of the love and sheltering care which
should have been theirs? While my wife was toiling
to earn her own support and to make provision for
my child, you were spending money which rightfully
belonged to them, with a lavish, almost  reckless, hand,
and rearing your children amid the luxury of which
you had maliciously deprived them. I have family
pride enough to provide for your needful support, for
I cannot see you suffer; so I will fit up Fernleigh
Lodge for your use while you live, and settle upon
you an annuity of two hundred pounds——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two hundred pounds!” interrupted Lady Linton,
in a tone of horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. With economy, that will be sufficient for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>your individual needs,” replied Sir William, coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will give Lillian as much more until her marriage,
when I shall hope to add something to the sum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His sister’s face was almost convulsed with rage
at this announcement. She had never imagined any
descent in the world so dreadful as this. She had
spent three times the amount now offered her in a
single year upon her own wardrobe, and now she was
expected to provide her whole support out of two
hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you suppose Lillian and I are going to be able
to live on a paltry sum like that?” she demanded, with
quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My wife and child lived on far less than that for
years, after you succeeded in ruining her faith in me,”
was the stern response. “It was no sum settled outright
upon her, either; she had to <em>toil</em> for it with her
own hands. She was not only the provider for the
household, but nurse, and governess, and seamstress
as well; while <em>your</em> children had their maids and
tutors, to say nothing of the bills which I have paid
sewing-girls and milliners for them. We will reverse
the order for a while, and the sum that I have named
will have to answer your purpose, unless your fertile
brain can invent some way to increase it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Linton groaned at this inflexible verdict, while
she writhed beneath his cutting words as if under a
lash.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could no longer shine in society, for there would
be no means for providing the necessary accessories—dresses,
jewels, laces, and the hundred other things
she so dearly loved and had always had for the simple
asking.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Her brilliant daughter, too, who had been so admired
in the gay circles they had frequented, would
have to drop out of her orbit now and be forgotten,
while there would be no opportunity for her to make
a distinguished marriage, which had been the acme of
her mother’s ambition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will the world think? William, how can you
be so cruel? It will blight all Lillian’s prospects,” she
sobbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If by blighting Lillian’s prospects you mean that
Lord Ernest Rathburn will give her the cold shoulder,
it will be a good thing to have them nipped in the
bud, for the fellow is devoid of both brains and principle,
and has absolutely nothing but his plethoric purse
to recommend him to anyone. I would much prefer
to have her never marry than become the wife of
such a coxcomb. As for your charge of cruelty, I
must say it ill becomes you to make that complaint;
you have been very extravagant during the last few
years, and the study of economy will not harm you;
besides, it is no more than right that <em>my</em> daughter
should now enjoy the full benefit of her inheritance,
which your children have so long usurped; not that
I regret anything that I have done for them, for they
are both dear to me, and I shall always be deeply interested
in their welfare. Will you go to Fernleigh,
Miriam?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She would have been glad to reject his offer with
scorn, but it was Hobson’s choice with her—that or
nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doubtless Percy would have offered his mother and
sister a home, when he was settled, but his estate was
yielding him comparatively little as yet, and she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>far too proud to accept favors at the hands of his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose there is nothing else for me to do,” she
wailed, and Sir William arose to leave her, uttering
a sigh over this new evidence of her total selfishness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He lost no time in fitting up the lodge, which was
a small but cozy and convenient house, about five
miles from Heathdale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie very kindly interested herself in all the arrangements,
for Lady Linton would not make a suggestion
or express a wish. When consulted upon any
point she assumed an injured air, and remarked it
was of no consequence—they could do just as they
saw fit.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was really a pleasant home when all completed,
and Lillian thanked her uncle and Lady Heath most
heartily for their kindness, and seemed quite interested
in the domestic details of their small establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In three weeks from the time of Sir William’s return,
Lady Linton took possession of Fernleigh, a
sadder if not a wiser or a better woman, and there
she literally buried herself, making no visits, and denying
herself to all callers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian, however, showed a much better spirit, and
tried to look upon the bright side of their condition.
She was growing very fond of the new occupants of
their old home, and was often invited to visit Heathdale,
and when Harry Webster at last came, for his
long-promised visit to Rupert, she did not fail to recognize
the young man’s superiority over her old admirer,
Lord Ernest, while Mr. Webster’s admiration
for the brilliant brunette was very marked from the
first.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>In less than three months it was formally announced
that Lillian Linton would, in the following fall,
through her marriage to Mr. Webster, become a
naturalized citizen of America, the country which she
had once affected to so despise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knight and his sister paid Lady Heath a visit
in March, and were overjoyed to find all her sorrow at
an end and the future looking so bright.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were persuaded to remain until after the marriage
of Rupert and Virgie, which was to occur about
Easter.</p>

<p class='c007'>A grand wedding had been arranged, and after a
tour on the Continent the young couple were to reside
at Englewood for a portion of each year and spend
the remainder with Sir William and Lady Heath at
their town house in London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lillian was invited to officiate as chief bridesmaid,
assisted by the Misses Huntington and the Duke of
Falmouth’s eldest daughter, while, of course, Harry
Webster was to be “best man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ceremony occurred in the fine old church at
Heathdale, which was crowded with the elite of the
country for miles around, for a report of the beauty
of the heiress of Heathdale had spread far and
near.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William gave away the bride, and the gift was
accompanied with his heartiest blessing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virgie, in her bridal robes, seemed the “fairest that
e’er the sun shone on,” and no one looking into her
dark eyes, so full of a calm, trustful joy, or noting the
fond, proud smile upon her young husband’s face,
could doubt that these were</p>

      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“Two souls in sweet accord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each for each caring and each itself unheard;</div>
      <div class='line'>True to truth, nor needing proof nor proving,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure to be ever loved and ever loving.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was a brilliant reception afterward in the
grand old mansion of which Sir William was so justly
proud, and the servants were heard to declare that
a finer wedding had never occurred within the memory
of the oldest among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Virgie came down stairs, after exchanging her
bridal dress for a traveling suit, Sir William met her
in the hall and drew her into the library for a last few
words. He put a package into her hands; and then,
drawing her to his breast, he said, with great tenderness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, this is your marriage dowry, to be
used just as you choose, and I am sure of its being
wisely used; but remember that you are to come freely
to your father if at any time you particularly wish for
anything. All that I have is yours. I live but for you
and my other Virgie, and Heathdale is your inheritance.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
